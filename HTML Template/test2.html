Axis Bank was trading 2% higher at Rs 522, as compared to 0.37% rise in the S&amp;P BSE Sensex.\nThus far in the calendar year 2018 (CY18), Bajaj Finance has outperformed the market by surging 33% as compared to 4% rise in the S&amp;P BSE Sensex. Axis Bank has underperformed the market by falling 8% during the period.\nCurrently, Bajaj Finance stood at number 18 position in overall market-cap ranking, has climbed 11 positions thus far in CY18.

The company had reported a better than expected 60% year on year jumped in its standalone net profit at Rs 7.21 billion in March quarter (Q4FY18). Assets quality of the company improves during the quarter with gross non-performing assets (NPA) and net NPA as of March 31, 2018 stood at 1.48% and 0.38% respectively.\nThe analysts remain constructive on the stock considering robust growth visibility emanating from superior management and diversified product franchise. Any pressure on margins from competition and asset mix should get mitigated by gains derived from better cost productivity, according to brokerage firm IIFL Wealth Research.\nDuring the same period, post Q4FY18 results, Axis Bank was down 5%, after the bank reported its first net loss of Rs 21.8 billion for Q4FY18, as NPAs soared and provisions for bad loans surged three times over the corresponding quarter last year.\nHowever, most of the local brokerage houses maintain ‘buy’ or ‘accumulate’ rating on the Axis Bank on expectation of sustained return on assets (ROA) expansion over the next 24 months to drive a multiple expansion as asset quality distractions recede.</td>

      <td>Nearly 55% of raw materials used by paint companies are crude oil derivatives and account for about 30-35% of the total raw material cost of the sector. Indian paint makers are increasingly shifting from solvent-based to water-based paints. Elevated input costs, especially crude oil prices, have taken the sheen off their gross margins in the past few quarters.\nNearly 55% of raw materials used by paint companies are crude oil derivatives and account for about 30-35% of the total raw material cost of the sector. In the past one year, crude oil prices have jumped by more than 40%. Not just that, prices of pigments like titanium dioxide, iron oxide and zinc oxide also remain elevated ( see chart ).\nSo, considering the cost pinch, there’s a growing tendency to use water-based paints, simply because water-based paint is less sensitive to movement in crude oil prices. As the name suggests, for water-based paints the binding agent is water-based. For the solvent-based paints, crude oil is required.\nSecondly, the preference for water-based paints over solvent paints is also rising among customers because it is easier to clean walls painted with water-based paints, said an analyst with a domestic brokerage house. Also, the former is more environment-friendly.\nIn fact, the slew of recent capacity expansions announced by key paint companies is focused more on water-based units.\nFor instance, market leader in decorative paints Asian Paints Ltd’s plant in Mysuru has 600,000 kilolitres per annum water-based capacity. The company has a larger share of water-based paints than competitors, pointed out brokerage house Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report dated 10 May.\nSimilarly, the leader in the industrial paints segment Kansai Nerolac Paints Ltd has been consistently increasing the share of water-based paints in its portfolio.\n“Nearly two-third of our revenue in the decorative paints category comes from water-based paints. In general, gross margins are better for water-based paints as compared to that for solvent-based,” Peeyush Bachlaus, general manager (marketing) at Kansai Nerolac Paints, said in an interview.\nHe added that globally, consumption of water-based paints is growing and demand is expected to remain high.\nMeanwhile, for now, paint makers are shielding their margins by taking price hikes. Most paint companies increased prices by 1.5% and 2% in March and May, respectively, of this calendar year. However, the rising share of water-based paints is expected to aid margin growth in the long term.\nFirst Published: Thu, Jun 21 2018. 09 14 AM IST</td>

      <td>Panama Papers: New records reveal fresh financial secrets of Indian clients The Indian Express 1 day ago ritu sarin\n© Provided by Indian Express 'Panama Papers' law firm announces that it is closing down\nTwo years after the Panama Papers blew the lid off how the global elite, including over 500 Indians, park and move their money in and out of secret tax havens, the Panama Papers are back — to reveal telling new details.\nMore than 1.2 million fresh documents, at least 12,000 of them linked to Indians, have been investigated by The Indian Express, in collaboration with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung. Just as was done with the earlier set of over 11.5 million documents in 2016.\nThis fresh investigation of Indian individuals and entities who figure in this new set of papers reveals how Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, which serviced their accounts, scrambled to respond to an unprecedented global crackdown. Significantly, confirming, in the process, the existence of several customers who had hitherto denied any links. And lifting the veil on the financial trail of new clients.\nRead full coverage of Panama Papers investigation Clearly, this new set — Panama Papers: The Aftermath — which The Indian Express has investigated, in the first set of a series of reports that begins today, will provide further teeth to the inquiries and audits ordered by the government and its investigative agencies\nThis second lot of the Panama Papers highlights details of offshore companies incorporated by a clutch of Indian businessmen who did not figure in the 2016 leak. These include Ajay Bijli, owner of PVR cinemas, and members of his family; Kavin Bharti Mittal, CEO of Hike Messenger and son of Sunil Mittal; and, Jalaj Ashwin Dani, son of Asian Paints promoter Ashwin Dani.\nThe new papers also show that several companies set up by Indians were, first, sent notices by Mossack Fonseca (several by November 2016) to produce missing information and these letters mentioned the name/s of the Beneficial Owner (BO), wherever available, or demanded that the name be immediately disclosed.\nIn the next stage, Mossack Fonseca served 90-day notices to clients informing them that the firm would resign as Registered Agent because the companies failed to meet legal due diligence requirements.\nThose whose links to offshore entities have been confirmed by Mossack Fonseca in a series of messages include Shiv Khemka, Amitabh Bachchan, Jehangir Sorabjee, K P Singh of the DLF Group and his immediate family, Anurag Kejriwal, Navin Mehra of Mehrasons Jewellers and Hajra Iqbal Memon and his family.\n© REUTERS/Carlos Jasso File: A Mossack Fonseca law firm logo is pictured in Panama City April 3, 2016. An illustrative case is how, shortly after the 2016 expose, Mossack Fonseca, in its communications, named Amitabh Bachchan as director of two companies Lady Shipping Ltd and Treasure Shipping Ltd and, subsequently, served the 90-day notice to him via UK-based Minerva Trust — the administrator for these companies — addressing him as director of a third company, Sea Bulk Shipping Company Ltd. The notice conveyed Mossack Fonseca’s intent to resign as the company’s agent saying that Sea Bulk Shipping did not fulfil “our due diligence requirements”.\nBachchan, who is under official scrutiny in connection with the Panama Papers, has denied any link to these companies and did not respond to an email sent by The Indian Express earlier this week.\nThousands of new documents connected to Mossack Fonseca’s Indian clients also reveal a disparate pattern — while some Indian owners of offshore companies rushed to liquidate their firms, others asked Mossack Fonseca to continue as their agent. Some even increased their holdings — like Lokesh Sharma, owner of British Virgin Islands-based Mardi Gras Holdings, who increased his share capital 30 times in February 2017.\nWhile P R S Oberoi resigned as director of J&amp;W Inc, a Bahamas company, in May 2016, Shishir Bajoria, who claimed his name in Mossack Fonseca records was a clerical mistake, contacted Mossack Fonseca through an intermediary to change the beneficial ownership of Haptic (BVI) Ltd which was liquidated in May 2016.\nIronically, on April 5, 2016, the very day of the global media leak, Mossack Fonseca sent an “assurance” to its subsidiary offices vowing “to make sure intrusions of this nature are prevented from happening in the future.” But within days, emails, full of alarm, continued to pour in, many on behalf of companies owned by Indians.\nA particularly revealing one is a May 9, 2016 email received by Mossack Fonseca from P P Shah and Associates, a Mumbai-based accountancy firm, in connection with offshore entity Whitefield Global Investments Ltd, whose beneficiaries are Baroda-based Chirayu Amin and members of his family.\n© AP FILE - In this Monday, April 4, 2016 file photo, a marquee of the Arango Orillac Building lists the Mossack Fonseca law firm, in Panama City. Denmark will buy leaked data from a Panamanian law firm that helped customers open offshore companies to avoid paying taxes, the Scandinavian country's taxation minister said Wednesday, Sept 7, 2016. Karsten Lauritzen said Denmark's tax authorities had received an anonymous offer over the summer to acquire data from the so-called "Panama Papers" that could involve up to 600 people. The ministry said communication with the anonymous source was made via encrypted channels. (AP Photo/Arnulfo Franco, File) It couldn’t be more direct: “Huge turbulence is started in the financial world including India. We need to respond to the Indian authorities asap as they have initiated inquiries based on the leaked report and documents which we understand are by and large correct information and documents…”\nThe very day of the Panama Papers expose , the Indian government had announced a probe by a Multi Agency Group (MAG).\nTwo years on, the information from the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) — which heads the probe unit — is that in all, 426 Indians named in the Panama Papers have been put under the scanner and, until June 2018, Rs 1,088 crore ($162.4 million) of undisclosed income has been detected.\nThe tax authorities continue to take action against those named in the Panama Papers and until November 2017, searches and surveys have been conducted in 58 cases. Prosecutions against 16 Indians named in the Panama Papers have been filed in courts.\nAs recently as June 13, three Delhi-based owners of entities were subject of early-morning simultaneous searches. They are Devesh Bahl and Rajeev Vaid (BVI entity: Pythhos Technology); Mohit Jain (BVI entity: Om Metals SPRL Limited) and Gurpal Singh Khurana (BVI entity: Top India Limited).\nThe new data and documents also reveals financial details about an array of global elites including football superstar Lionel Messi, Argentina’s President Mauricio Macri’s family and shell companies owned by iconic French jeweller Pierre Cartier.\n(Also watch: Meryl Streep to star in film on Panama Papers)\nReplay Video SETTINGS OFF HD HQ SD LO (Video by the Times of India)\nPanama Papers investigation was carried out by Indian Express as a part of ICIJ</td>

The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists – to which The Indian Express belongs – has been looking into the new trove along with German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung , which first blew the lid off the global scam after examining the earlier set of over 11.5 million documents in 2016. This fresh investigation of Indian individuals and entities who figure in this new set of papers reveals how the now defunct Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, which serviced their accounts, scrambled to respond to an unprecedented global crackdown — confirming in the process, the existence of several customers who had hitherto denied any links, and lifting the veil on the financial trail of new clients. New offshore account details have emerged about an array of global elites, including soccer superstar Lionel Messi and the Argentine president’s family. Messi, the Barcelona star who is now leading Argentina in the Russia World Cup, was already under investigation in Spain on charges that he and his father, Jorge Horacio Messi, used offshore companies in Belize and Uruguay to avoid paying millions of dollars in taxes when the Panama Papers revealed he owned yet another offshore company: Mega Star Enterprises, based in Panama. When asked about the company in April 2016, the Messis told ICIJ and partners that Mega Star was “totally inactive”. Internal emails from the newly-leaked Mossack Fonseca records call that claim into question. This second lot of the Panama Papers also highlights details of offshore companies incorporated by a clutch of Indian businessmen who did not figure in the 2016 leak. These include Ajay Bijli, owner of PVR cinemas, and members of his family; Kavin Bharti Mittal, chief executive of Hike Messenger and son of Sunil Mittal; and Jalaj Ashwin Dani, son of Asian Paints promoter Ashwin Dani. The new papers also show that several companies set up by Indians were first sent notices by Mossack Fonseca (several by November 2016) to produce missing information and these letters mentioned the name/s of the Beneficial Owner (BO), wherever available, or demanded that the name be immediately disclosed.

The Bachchan case An illustrative case is how, shortly after the 2016 expose, Mossack Fonseca, in its communications, named Amitabh Bachchan as director of two companies Lady Shipping Ltd and Treasure Shipping Ltd and, subsequently, served the 90-day notice to him via UK-based Minerva Trust — the administrator for these companies — addressing him as director of a third company, Sea Bulk Shipping Company Ltd. The notice conveyed Mossack Fonseca’s intent to resign as the company’s agent saying that Sea Bulk Shipping did not fulfil “our due diligence requirements”. Bachchan, who is under official scrutiny in connection with the Panama Papers, has denied any link to these companies and did not respond to an email sent by The Indian Express earlier this week. The Argentine President In the case of Argentine President Mauricio Macri, emails between Mossack Fonseca’s head office in Panama and its Uruguay branch in September and October 2016 show that employees were discussing a plan to backdate documents to conceal the fact that the firm knew that a company it had set up in the Bahamas, Fleg Trading Co, was controlled by the family of Macri. Macri and other family members were directors of Fleg Trading, the original Panama Papers investigation revealed. His father was the owner. Anti-money-laundering laws required Mossack Fonseca to know such information. Mossack Fonseca employees discussed having Macri’s accountant produce a handwritten document in 2016, but dated years earlier, that would confirm the company’s owner, according to emails. The accountant dismissed the idea as “very risky” since the letter “could be refuted easily by an expert calligrapher”, who would pick up that the document was written more recently than the purported earlier date, according to Mossack Fonseca’s internal emails. A spokesman for the Macri family’s company, Socma, told ICIJ media partner La Nación that the president’s father declared his ownership of Fleg Trading, which was confirmed by a judge in Argentina. The spokesman said he had no information or comment on the discussions between Mossack Fonseca and the Uruguayan accountant.</td>

The previous leak was reported in 2016 where more than 500 Indians were named in the documents of Mossack Fonseca.\nThe report says that 426 Indians are under the scrutiny of the multi-agency group (MAG) set up by the central government. Black money of over Rs 1,000 crores has been detected by the MAG probing the leads from 2016 leak.\nWhat is new in the fresh Panama Papers leak?\nFresh documents from the Panama Papers contain names of some big Indian business magnets who did not figure in the 2016 leak. These names include: PVR cinema owner Ajay Bijli and his family members Hike Messenger CEO Kavin Bharti Mittal - the son of Sunil Mittal, the chairman of Bharti Airtel Asian Paints promoter Ashwin Dani's son Jalaj Ashwin Dani.\nThese papers also confirm the business links exposed in the previous leak and then denied by Indian nationals. Those Indian nationals whose links to offshore entities have been confirmed by the fresh leak include: Shiv Vikram Khemka - SUN group patriarch Nand Lal Khemka's son Actor Amitabh Bachchan Jehangir Sorabjee - the son of former attorney general Soli Sorabjee DLF Group's KP Singh and his immediate family Anurag Kejriwal - the former Delhi Lok Satta Party leader Navin Mehra of Mehrasons Jewellers Hajra Iqbal Memon- Wife of underworld don Iqbal Mirchi.\nShortly after the 2016 expose, law firm Mossack Fonseca named Amitabh Bachchan in a notice through UK-based Minerva Trust. The notice also named the actor as a director of three companies Lady Shipping Ltd and Treasure Shipping Ltd - old - and Sea Bulk Shipping Company Ltd - new. Minerva Trust has been identified as the administrator of these companies. Amitabh Bachchan has denied any links with the companies and assets linked to tax haven countries.\nThe new documents also show that Lokesh Sharma, owner of British Virgin Islands-based Mardi Gras Holdings, increased his share capital 30 times in the aftermath of 2016 Panama Papers leak.\nSK Bajoria Group promoter Shishir Bajoria's name had cropped in the previous leak also. But he had attributed it to a "clerical mistake". The new documents show that soon after the 2016 leak reports, Bajoria had approached Mossack Fonseca to change the beneficial ownership of Haptic Ltd. It was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and liquidated in May 2016.</td>

He became a tax resident in India on account of his presence to manage tech start-up from the financial year 2011-12 and accordingly the tax returns filed with the tax authorities provide full disclosure and details about his ownership of KBM Global,” the official said. Minerva Trust &amp; Corporate Services, a reputed professional service provider, is the appointed administrator of KBM Global.\n“They have informed us that they moved all their clients to Harney’s Corporate Services in 2016 for registered agency services,” the official said.\nKavin is founder and chief executive officer of Hike Messenger and son of Sunil Bharti Mittal.\nThe fresh leaks showed that six months after the earlier Panama Paper leaks, a notice was published by British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission with the information that the registered agent of the company had been changed from Mossack Fonseca to Harney’s Corporate Services, both located in Tortola in the British Virgin Islands (BVI).\nThe other set of documents showed that how the shareholding pattern of these two companies changed in March 2106 and how 14 shares from Anten Resources, which was another shareholder of KBM Global, were transferred to Minerva Nominees.\nThese shares were held under declaration of trust for Kavin Bharti Mittal.\nDani said, “You will appreciate that your presumption, if any, that our investments are illegal, is ill-founded. Please note that this investment is legal and we have reported this investment in our returns to the I-T authorities as well.”\nThe fresh leaks showed that Dani, who resigned from Asian Paints in April 2017, and his wife Vita Dani were linked to a BVI entity called Poinsettia Group Holdings.\nNaveen Wadhwa, tax experts at Taxmann, said all ordinary residents filing return of income (ITR) for the financial year 2011-2012 and subsequent years were required to disclose their foreign assets and income earned outside India.\n“In case a taxpayer failed to disclose such details in ITR then the same shall be deemed to be an undisclosed income of taxpayer.\n"Any undisclosed income detected by the I-T department, in case of person found during Panama Paper leak, would be taxed at a flat rate of 60 per cent plus a further penalty of 10 per cent of tax,” he said. The finance ministry said the Panama Paper leaks involving 426 people have been already investigated by the I-T department and other member agencies of the MAG.\nAfter thorough investigation, involving examination of the disclosures made in the ITRs, particularly the foreign assets (FA) schedule, residential status, responses to questionnaires issued, responses received from foreign jurisdictions and details of foreign remittances made, 352 cases were found to be non-actionable, the ministry said.\nAmong other 74 cases, it said “invasive actions” were taken in 62 cases, with searches conducted in 50 cases, and surveys in 12 cases leading to detection of undisclosed foreign investments of about Rs 1,140 crore.\nIn 16 cases, criminal prosecution complaints have been filed in jurisdictional courts which are at various stages of hearing. In 32 cases, notices under Section 10 of the Black Money Act have been issued.\n“The investigations conducted in Panama Paper cases reflect the government’s continued focus in dealing with black money stashed abroad. The promptness in action is more than evident as most of the actionable cases have been effectively addressed,” the ministry said. It further said that though the investigating agencies faced problems of incomplete data and absence of financial information as well as not very prompt cooperation from other countries, the overall outcome has been “very satisfactory”.\nThe government would like to assure that the fresh series of Panama Papers information would also be effectively addressed within a reasonable time frame, it said.\nThe ministry said that the standard operating procedures in place for investigating such cases will be followed.\nThe procedure involves examining the information revealed in the media release with the disclosures made by the alleged persons in the annual returns of income filed, particularly in the FA schedule, foreign remittance details will be undertaken expeditiously, followed by raising of relevant queries.

      <td>Newswire How paint makers are responding to rising oil prices\nElevated oil prices have dented the margins of paint makers, causing a strategic shift in their product mix By Harsha Jethmalani | Jun 22, 2018\nIndian paint makers are increasingly shifting from solvent-based to water-based paints.\nElevated input costs, especially crude oil prices, have taken the sheen off their gross margins in the past few quarters.\nNearly 55% of raw materials used by paint companies are crude oil derivatives and account for about 30-35% of the total raw material cost of the sector. In the past one year, crude oil prices have jumped by more than 40%. Not just that, prices of pigments like titanium dioxide, iron oxide and zinc oxide also remain elevated (see chart).\nSubscribe to the free Value Research Insight newsletter\nSo, considering the cost pinch, there's a growing tendency to use water-based paints, simply because water-based paint is less sensitive to movement in crude oil prices. As the name suggests, for water-based paints the binding agent is water-based. For the solvent-based paints, crude oil is required.\nSecondly, the preference for water-based paints over solvent paints is also rising among customers because it is easier to clean walls painted with waterbased paints, said an analyst with Prices of key raw materials for making solvent-based paints remain elevated. a domestic brokerage house. Also, the former is more environment-friendly.\nIn fact, the slew of recent capacity expansions announced by key paint companies is focused more on water-based units.\nFor instance, market leader in decorative paints Asian Paints Ltd's plant in Mysuru has 600,000 kilolitres per annum water-based capacity. The company has a larger share of waterbased paints than competitors, pointed out brokerage house Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report dated 10 May.\nSimilarly, the leader in the industrial paints segment Kansai Nerolac Paints Ltd has been consistently increasing the share of water-based paints in its portfolio.\n"Nearly two-third of our revenue in the decorative paints category comes from water-based paints. In general, gross margins are better for water-based paints as compared to that for solventbased," Peeyush Bachlaus, general manager (marketing) at Kansai Nerolac Paints, said in an interview.\nHe added that globally, consumption of water-based paints is growing and demand is expected to remain high.\nMeanwhile, for now, paint makers are shielding their margins by taking price hikes. Most paint companies increased prices by 1.5% and 2% in March and May, respectively, of this calendar year. However, the rising share of water-based paints is expected to aid margin growth in the long term\nIn arrangement with HT Syndication | MINT Most Popular</td>

      <td>\nThis has been a topic that a number of readers of this blog have been requesting for since quite a while. Was finally able to pen this down over the weekend.\nPainting of the home has been a major area of grouse and confusion for home owners. Grouse because vendors have started charging per sqft. rates and no longer work on a labour only basis. Due to this overall costing has sky rocketed. And Confusion because there is too much choice in paints and wall finishes available in the market – much more than what an average human mind can evaluate &amp; fathom. The increasing cost of paint has made options of good quality wallpapers viable adding further to the confusion on whether to use paint or wallpaper.\nNet-net customers are struggling with to balance their budgets with the coats of Putty, Primer, Paint and Paper that it will take to give their homes that desired look.\nTo demystify this home painting problem lets first start with the basics i.e. what is the painting process. We will then get into best practices, rates, options and so on. The P ainting P rocess:\nThe P ainting p rocess can be summarized as a step of P’ s …and now this is starting to sound like a P oem by P hilip Kotler (Google him if you don’t know who he is :)). Let me explain – P ainting has 2 main steps – Wall P reparation and the P aint Coat. The Wall preparation itself includes alternate coats of P rimer and P atti/ P o P. The coat of Patti is to even out the damaged surface and to smoothen the wall while it’s the Primer that holds everything together. Without the Primer the whole surface will flake and fall apart.\nThe Painter would start with sanding the wall. Once its smoothened, the first coat of Primer is applied. Primer itself is of 2 kinds – Water based and Oil Based…more on that later. Once the Primer dries out, usually in about 12 to 14 hours , the damaged portions of the wall are repaired with the putty. In case the wall is uneven then a coat of PoP (Plaster of Paris) is applied followed by sanding. Once that dries its back to another coat of Primer, another 12 hours of drying time and another round of sanding. NOW the wall is ready to be painted. Usually two coats of Primer separated by one coat of Putty/ PoP is enough. Painters will tell you that the wall needs 2 coats of each but that is usually and overkill with no effect on the final output and can be avoided to save cost.\nRemember we spoke about Water based and Oil Based Primers – these exist to add to the overall confusion. Most top coats (Paints) are fine with a Water Based Primer, however some top coats – such as enamel or Textures, do better on an Oil based primer. In addition, say if you are applying wall paint on a plywood, something that you should do only under expert supervision, then an Oil based primer is recommended. Net – net, when you choose the paint , check with the paint vendor on the right Primer to be used as that directly impacts the longevity of the paint.\nIt just started raining outside and fortunately that reminded me of something that I missed. If your wall or any portion of it is damp or algae/ fungus infested then it will need waterproofing or algae treatment before you venture into the Primer Putty &amp; Painting bit. While Waterproofing is a bit complicated and requires an expert ‘s attention, algae/ fungus treatment just needs the chemical to be mixed with the Primer and applied to the wall. If you have any such issues on your walls then be sure to bring it to the attention of the Painter so that he treats the wall appropriately.\nOk, Now that the wall is treated and ready it’s time to Paint. Any paint that you buy will need to be diluted (usually with water) in the ratio given in the tech specs of the paint. Once the paint is diluted the process is simple and something that all of us learnt in Kindergarten. Dip the Brush (or roller) in paint and apply. Usually roller finishes are better and more even compared to a brush hence it is recommended to use rollers. The painter would evenly cover the wall with paint with a W shaped motion (thank God it’s not a P again). There are a number of videos available on You Tube on the W motion and you can refer the same. Each coat of paint needs min 8 hours of drying time, however in Bangalore weather its best to wait 12 to 14 hours before applying the second coat.\nUsually 2 coats of paint are enough to mask the Primer completely and give the desired colour, however if you want it darker a third coat can be applied. Do however be careful because the Paint colour usually deepens with time, you are therefore better off with a shade too light rather than a shade too dark. If even after 2 – 3 days it seems too light for your taste only then consider a third coat.\nHome Painting Rates &amp; Options: Home Painting rates in Bangalore vary. The cheapest way to get it done is to find someone who charges for labour and you provide the material, ho www ever - there good reason why that wwww is longer than what good English demands - it is impossible to find someone who would do that….I mean pick up the contract without the material. Even we designers nowadays are forced to give out our paint contracts on a “with material” basis due to this issue. Typical rates would start at ₹ 14 psft for Tractor Emulsion (or Equivalent) all the way to ₹ 30 PSFT for Royale or equivalent. If one is on a budget then Premium emulsion at around ₹ 20 PSFT is something that you will settle at. Between ₹ 30 to 60 PSFT the option of good quality wall paper also opens up. Wallpapers are strong contenders for theme and highlight walls since specialty textures in paint cost approximately the same. Additionally, wall papers offer more variety, ease of use and time savings. The only drawback of wall papers is that they cannot be applied on a wall that has even a bit of dampness, hence exterior facing walls that face the direct brunt of rain are a no – no.\nThat completes it I guess. There are other best practices around masking the skirtings and door window frames before painting, how best to paint on the wall edges by alternating between a brush and a roller etc. You should be able to Google those and find out. Do also refer to the websites of Asian Paints, Nerolac and Berger where loads of details, best practices, technical specs, application processes for EACH of their range of paints etc. is available.\nAs always would welcome your comments, questions and feedback\nSigning Off\nNandita\nP S: Here's me now P ushing the P ublish button....uggg !!!</td>

      <td>National Account Executive, DBK Concepts LLC Posted on: Nov, 21 2016 This is a game changer in GE's production and prototyping. It also has huge implications across the GE global supply chain with regard to the management of their support and spare parts network. Kai Furmans Professor, KIT Posted on: May, 22 2017 I am referencing to the comment that leasing of warehousing equipment (beyond forklift trucks) is a vision for 2030. Just recently in Europe, such a business model has started, see here: https://next-intralogistics.de/ I am following with a lot of interest, how the business develops. Stuart Rosenberg Supply Chain Consultant, First Choice Supply Chain Posted on: Jun, 05 2017 If we limit the standard on judging or determining the best supply chain to just three calculations it does not tell the entire picture. Financial performance metrics are valuable as they capture the economic consequences of business decisions. But supply chain managers make decsions and use organizational resources that impact a company's financial well being. Where is a firm's earnings over a period of time determined by sales less product costs and general/adminsitrative costs? Where is the metric for determining the sources and uses of cash from three perspectives - operational, investment and financial? Where are these supply chain metrics: on-time delivery, lead time, response time to customers, product returns, procurement costs, network distance, inventory carrying costs, forecasting accuracy, sourcing time, etc,. Without knowing the results of all these supply chain calculations the there must be a question as to the accuracy of the 25 top supply chains. Dustin Calitz Project Commercialization Manager, Mondelez Posted on: Jun, 06 2017 I feel this ranking misses the mark in SC. It does not seem to consider a key indicator in days inventory on hand, which is key to determining a SC company's ability to forecast, manage inventory costs and reduce aged stock. In additiion I realize it's difficult to understand what goes into the customer survey, but would I assume specific metrics are being asked. For examples customer's opinion on service level differentiation and the ability to deliver the right product on time, which should then be allocated a bigger weighting than 10%. It would also be interesting to take a view of the above list's SKU portfolio complexity, seasonality and launches/promotions. I would again assume some companies on the list above have a far more complex SC to manage and lead, ultimately requiring a lot more innovation within a SC to stay ahead of competitors, and ultimately satisfy their customers demands. I understand above metrics are difficult to measure, as mentioned in the article, but they somehow need to be considered to give a true reflection. Michael Hurd Posted on: Jun, 10 2017\nA Very Good Article...\nWhile some feel that lean is a scam that pushes for more out of the personnel and out of the companies through reduction of waste and adding value for the customer, there are several things to remember:\n1) Lean methodologies are designed and implemented to reduce time wasting, so this may seem that you are working harder as an employee. 2) Lean methdoligies only work when everyone from the janitor to the owner of the company get involved and back the program.\n3) Lean methods are there to make you work smarter not harder, although it may feel you are working harder.\n4) YES... Sometimes lean methodologies fail! This is due to project overun or taking on too large a problem and trying to fix it all in one go and not taking the smaller problems that are associated with the large problem and fixing them first. Sometimes fixing the small problems leads to resolution of the larger problem. Akhil Director Supply Chain , skuchain Posted on: Jul, 31 2017 The Supply Chain technology is not considered a problem because traditionally supply chains are thought to be cost centres unlike sales functions. The tendency, in general, to limit expenses and cost cutting on upgrades for technology and for talent have been hindering progress for the businesses. Supply chains lack real time visbility and above all trust across the value chain (not that the participants are dishonest) rather it's about the cascading effects referred to as the bull-whip effect which causes higher magnitudes of disruptions. Supply chain real time information should top the list . Another problem is that of multi homing as so much data is available across several feeds of IOT/Email/Internet /Mobility/ERP that organisations tend to have issues around finding a single platform to collate them for meaning analysis. Blockchain (if deployed appropriately) can be a great solution for solving the issues around the supply chain. Mike Ledyard Vested Program Faculty, Vested Way / University ofTennessee Posted on: Aug, 04 2017 Excellent article. It very much points to the need for Shared Risk / Shared Reward as we teach at Vested. Suppliers will respond when they are made part of the team, and they have a lot to bring to the game. The service provider is the subject matter expert in the services provided, and in an excellent position to enhance the capabilities and services offered by the shipper. Andrew Downard Managing Director, AD Supply Chain Group Pty Ltd Posted on: Aug, 05 2017 As the article points out it is not a lack of technology that is holding back performance but rather a failure to form the right sort of relationships. As well as the length of such relatiohships, practitioners should consider employing arrangements that incentivise both parties to innovate and deliver levels of performance and profit that neither thought possible. By far the best model I have come across to achieve this is the Vested Outsourcing model developed by researchers from the University of Tennessee. See www.vestedway.com for information on the model and case studies that show how others have benefited from creating a Vested deal. Najma logistics, threelineshipping Posted on: Aug, 23 2017 Very informational article. The major focus of logistics is on e-commerce. There is a need to optimize every component of logistics by following the latest trends and technologies. Thanks for uploading this article. Sameer Shukkla Consulting Partner, Wipro Inc. Posted on: Sep, 17 2017 I have recently co-authored a white paper with my colleague wherein we have looked at 2 fundamental guiding principles - 1. Always have enough to Sell / Produce 2. Do not have excess to Sell / Produce These 2 Golden Rules can be the foundation of keeping optimal inventory levels and for organizations to achieve the same. We have looked at a framework which tries to reduce the phase mismatch between Demand &amp; Supply, and tries to bring the shape of the supply curve closer to shape of the demand curve. We have classified symptoms and underlying root causes for the above "Phase mismatch" and "Curve Mismatch" between Demand and Supply, and then talked about addresssing those individual root causes to strive towards Leaner Inventory levels while maintaining or improving service levels. So to answer your question, we feel the Companies which have addresed these causes have been able to keep DIO horizontal or even going down, while others have not been able to control rising DIO because of not addressing the root causes. Simon Eagle SCM Consultant, Camelot MC Posted on: Sep, 17 2017 You ask why turns are flat or declining despite lots of attention and technology. The answer is, I think, 2 fold: the supply chain environments VUCA (Volatliity, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity) is on a continuous upward curve and this means that forecast accuracy inevitably declines in parallel - and much of that inaccuracy is hidden by the statistics. For instance a company with, seemingy good, 80% mix accuracy will find that figure is skewed so high by the few high volume / low variability items. 80% of the items will be achieving considerably less than 60% error. So most item level forecasts used for driving replenishment through an MPS (be it ERP or APS) are simply leading to unbalanced stocks, service threats and continuous expediting / fire-fighting. These schedule interrutions are "variability" that is disrupting flow and, thereby, increasing lead-times, using unplanned capacity and generating excessive (and still unbalanced) inventories. The replacement in ex-stock supply chains is "enterprise(s)-wide" pull which also uses "push" for extreme/exceptional events. Its other key characteristics are that the supply chain is decoupled and is demand-driven. And now it can be implemented using SAP since they announced they they have co-developed an enhancement for IBP that supports this transformational way of working - up to 50% inventory reduction, requiring less capacity and shorter lead-times all while achieving planned service levels. See https://www.camelot-itlab.com/en/camelot-demand-driven-lean-planning-suite-for-sap/ and https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/supply-chain-flow-what-why-how-simon-eagle/ John Smith Research &amp; Development, Octopus Tech Solutions Posted on: Sep, 18 2017 IoT is without a doubt starting to become a major factor in the profitability of various companies. In the manufacturing sector, we will see it come into the front by the end of 2020 completely. Various sectors have already adapted IoT solutions like the security industry or companies offering BPO Services India . Contact centers not just in India and China but across the world have adapted technology following the principles of IoT. The manufacturing sector is soon going to follow. Girish Maniyar Chief Manager Development Initiatives, Asian Paints Posted on: Sep, 28 2017 I can speak with some context. While efficiency and tools can reduce inventory, we also see the number of SKUs and new products increasing, and also the number of sales/depot points. This means the inventory in such cases, can start with very high number and with more customization and choices available to the consumer, so there is no end to the long tail of products available within a category. It is unlikely that the slow/dead goods are written off so easily to be not included here. A larger question, would it be purely an IO problem or also a Demand Planning (Forecast Error) problem? A higher cycle time of service but a better fill rate can improve inventory performance, by aggregation. But a bad forecast can do away all the good work you do in inventory planning. Do you have numbers for decorative coatings in the list? I did not see something there only for decorative coatings. Reo B Hatfield Chief Operating Executive , BestTransport Posted on: Oct, 20 2017 My opinion is that peaks and valley are just nice graphics to explain. Smooth responses save the day. 3PLs just adjust to the climate and the areas of movement of Logistics. One purpose of the 3PL movement was to adjust to an always changing market. They will never be fixed and will flex as the logistics changes. 3PL companies have vast knowledge of their business. Their success is their ability to move up and down as the market flows. They bring a level playing field to the transportation world that in the past was rigid but looked good on spreadsheets. Industry graphic personnel like to be able to answer all the changes because they can only see documents. 3PLs see the needs, the issues, the positive changes and the knowledge to know why and when to adjust. They (3PLs) have smoothed the waves of the past and everybody likes to see the spikes so they know something is there to clearly report on. Smooth sailing is boring but sure gets you where you want to go. Catherine Dennis Supply Chain Manager, Indak Mfg Corp Posted on: Oct, 26 2017 So the horrific and severe worldwide allocation of electronic components is not an issue? Don't tell that to the automotive buyers. It's HORRIBLE. Lead times out to up to 76 weeks. Why not write about that? It's killing us, our customers and the big automakers. Huub Logistics Manager, Shell Posted on: Nov, 11 2017 I suggest McKinsey to do a bit more research in Prof Gattorna’s dynamic alignment. This article only scratches the surface a tiny bit. Much more to be found reading about the alignment concept. Joseph George Farmer, Field Vista Posted on: Dec, 07 2017 Primarily Vision is required followed by Assigned Focus on objectives. Or maybe just love for USA. The market will not find its way unless it's for organic vegetables and RRR. Two to three years later will take two to three years longer to the end of the decade, and this is viable today. God bless america from its present distraction. Gary Buchs Owner Operator , Self, Landstar Business Capacity Owner Posted on: Dec, 17 2017 In My Opinion, the fact that capacity will tighten should be obvious to everyone engaged in the transportation. Capacity to move freight isn’t how many trucks or trailers are in the system or what a computer program says, it still is truck driver based and poorly-managed companies won’t be able to imporove this fact. Investing in people is still most important! Get ready to pay higher prices for goods and services. I think we could lose 10% of Capacity in many areas. Dan Pres., Bioptechs Posted on: Dec, 20 2017 After all the ground we have lost in the productive sector and the additional burden that loss of our productive momentum has placed on our society, somebody tell me why so many people are against the actions necessary to restore our vital productive infrastructure! It is like the left enjoys shooting itself in the foot! Jayaram Posted on: Mar, 04 2018 Great article and thank you for summerizing the predications. What does it mean to country like India where the labour is still cheap? Where the logistics cost is still on the higher side compared to some of the developed nations? Herb Shields President , HCS Consulting Posted on: Mar, 06 2018\nI agree that robots can replace some amount of manual labor in logistics centers. However as you mention, the labor pool is shrinking. We need more training programs such as the one provided by the Greater West Town organization in Chicago. Www.gwtp.org. (It is a program that your readers should find interesting.) Billy Posted on: Mar, 13 2018 Thanks for this very informative article . Doug Murless Country Manager, krunchbox (www.krunchbox.com) Posted on: Mar, 18 2018\nGone are the days when consumers will wait for a retailer to have the product back in stock, those days are done. We live in the "I want it now" society and with Amazon in their pocket consumers can easily "now" it to themself the next day right from their phone.\nThe importance of product availability is under the microscope at all retailers as an empty shelf equals lost customers, a poor customer experience and entirely abandoned purchases. We are on a mission at krunchbox to help suppliers fix their product availability and sell thru and improve their buyer relationships, hopefully before their retail partner fines start rolling in and or we see more retailers close. NikhilSingh Executive, Carmatec INC Posted on: Mar, 21 2018 You are correct There are government programs to encourage investment at small and mid-size manufacturers, but McKinsey says these programs generally have smaller budgets, less certainty of ongoing funding, and more constraints on their mandates than comparable programs in other countries. Policy makers should examine which existing initiatives are producing the most promising results, then scale up those efforts and commit to them for the long term.</td>

      <td>Sensex starts on negative note, falls 51 pts 12:22 IST Maximum Length : 250 File Photo Mumbai: The benchmark BSE Sensex got off to a lower start on Friday, tracking a sell-off in global markets amid escalating trade war worries. The 30-share index, which had lost 114.94 points in the previous session, fell by another 50.91 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 35,381.48 in early trade. Capital goods, realty, infrastructure, power, healthcare and metal stocks showed weakness, falling by up to 0.35 per cent. The NSE Nifty also was quoting lower by 5.20 points, or 0.05 per cent, at 10,735.90. Major losers included Coal India, Reliance Industries, Asian Paints, SBI, Adani Ports, Sun Pharma, IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, PowerGrid, Bajaj Auto, Maruti Suzuki and HDFC Bank, declining up to 1.40 per cent. According to traders, sustained selling by participants in line with a weak trend at other Asian markets following overnight losses at the Wall Street amid investor concerns about the trade dispute between the US and China dampened trading sentiments here. Meanwhile, India will raise customs duty on 29 products, including almond, walnut and pulses, imported from the US as a retaliatory action against the tariff hike by Washington. The duty hike would come into effect from August 4, the Finance Ministry said in a notification. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 0.15 per cent and Shanghai Composite shed 0.70 per cent in early trade today. Japan's Nikkei too fell 0.74 per cent.

Significantly, it also confirms the existence of several customers who had hitherto denied any links. And lifts the veil on the financial trail of new clients. Written by Ritu Sarin , Jay Mazoomdaar | New Delhi | Updated: June 21, 2018 7:10:40 pm Panama Papers: Over 12,000 new records investigated by The Indian Express give teeth to regulatory agencies probing trails of Indians, their firms in secret tax havens.\nTwo years after the Panama Papers blew the lid off how the global elite, including over 500 Indians, park and move their money in and out of secret tax havens, the Panama Papers are back — to reveal telling new details. More than 1.2 million fresh documents, at least 12,000 of them linked to Indians, have been investigated by The Indian Express, in collaboration with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung. Just as was done with the earlier set of over 11.5 million documents in 2016.\nThis fresh investigation of Indian individuals and entities who figure in this new set of papers reveals how Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, which serviced their accounts, scrambled to respond to an unprecedented global crackdown. Significantly, confirming, in the process, the existence of several customers who had hitherto denied any links. And lifting the veil on the financial trail of new clients.\nPanama Papers: Click for full coverage Panama Papers: The Aftermath\nClearly, this new set — Panama Papers: The Aftermath — which The Indian Express has investigated, in the first set of a series of reports that begins today, will provide further teeth to the inquiries and audits ordered by the government and its investigative agencies.\nThis second lot of the Panama Papers highlights details of offshore companies incorporated by a clutch of Indian businessmen who did not figure in the 2016 leak. These include Ajay Bijli, owner of PVR cinemas, and members of his family; Kavin Bharti Mittal, CEO of Hike Messenger and son of Sunil Mittal; and, Jalaj Ashwin Dani, son of Asian Paints promoter Ashwin Dani.\nThe new papers also show that several companies set up by Indians were, first, sent notices by Mossack Fonseca (several by November 2016) to produce missing information and these letters mentioned the name/s of the Beneficial Owner (BO), wherever available, or demanded that the name be immediately disclosed.\nALSO READ | Panama Papers: Among new names, telecom czar’s son, a business couple\nIn the next stage, Mossack Fonseca served 90-day notices to clients informing them that the firm would resign as Registered Agent because the companies failed to meet legal due diligence requirements.\nThose whose links to offshore entities have been confirmed by Mossack Fonseca in a series of messages include Shiv Khemka, Amitabh Bachchan , Jehangir Sorabjee, K P Singh of the DLF Group and his immediate family, Anurag Kejriwal, Navin Mehra of Mehrasons Jewellers and Hajra Iqbal Memon and his family.\nREAD | Day after query on offshore ownership, Shishir Bajoria moved to get his name removed from records\nAn illustrative case is how, shortly after the 2016 expose, Mossack Fonseca, in its communications, named Amitabh Bachchan as director of two companies Lady Shipping Ltd and Treasure Shipping Ltd and, subsequently, served the 90-day notice to him via UK-based Minerva Trust — the administrator for these companies — addressing him as director of a third company, Sea Bulk Shipping Company Ltd. The notice conveyed Mossack Fonseca’s intent to resign as the company’s agent saying that Sea Bulk Shipping did not fulfil “our due diligence requirements”.\nBachchan, who is under official scrutiny in connection with the Panama Papers, has denied any link to these companies and did not respond to an email sent by The Indian Express earlier this week.\nREAD | Panama Papers: Inside the fall of Mossack Fonseca – panic, chaos, and the end\nThousands of new documents connected to Mossack Fonseca’s Indian clients also reveal a disparate pattern — while some Indian owners of offshore companies rushed to liquidate their firms, others asked Mossack Fonseca to continue as their agent. Some even increased their holdings — like Lokesh Sharma, owner of British Virgin Islands-based Mardi Gras Holdings, who increased the authorised share capital 30 times in February 2017.\nWhile P R S Oberoi resigned as director of J&amp;W Inc, a Bahamas company, in May 2016, Shishir Bajoria, who claimed his name in Mossack Fonseca records was a clerical mistake, contacted Mossack Fonseca through an intermediary to change the beneficial ownership of Haptic (BVI) Ltd which was liquidated in May 2016.\nREAD | Panama Papers: New data spills more offshore secrets of Lionel Messi, Argentina President Mauricio Macri\nIronically, on April 5, 2016, the very day of the global media leak, Mossack Fonseca sent an “assurance” to its subsidiary offices vowing “to make sure intrusions of this nature are prevented from happening in the future.” But within days, emails, full of alarm, continued to pour in, many on behalf of companies owned by Indians.\nA particularly revealing one is a May 9, 2016 email received by Mossack Fonseca from P P Shah and Associates, a Mumbai-based accountancy firm, in connection with offshore entity Whitefield Global Investments Ltd, whose beneficiaries are Baroda-based Chirayu Amin and members of his family.\nIt couldn’t be more direct: “Huge turbulence is started in the financial world including India. We need to respond to the Indian authorities asap as they have initiated inquiries based on the leaked report and documents which we understand are by and large correct information and documents…”\nThe very day of the Panama Papers expose, the Indian government had announced a probe by a Multi Agency Group (MAG). Panama Papers: Two years on\nTwo years on, the information from the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) — which heads the probe unit — is that in all, 426 Indians named in the Panama Papers have been put under the scanner and, until June 2018, Rs 1,088 crore ($162.4 million) of undisclosed income has been detected.\nThe tax authorities continue to take action against those named in the Panama Papers and until November 2017, searches and surveys have been conducted in 58 cases. Prosecutions against 16 Indians named in the Panama Papers have been filed in courts.\nAs recently as June 13, three Delhi-based owners of entities were subject of early-morning simultaneous searches. They are Devesh Bahl and Rajeev Vaid (BVI entity: Pythhos Technology); Mohit Jain (BVI entity: Om Metals SPRL Limited) and Gurpal Singh Khurana (BVI entity: Top India Limited).</td>

SHO Jagdish Kumar, investigating officer from the Talwandi Sabo police station, said on the complaint of Anjan Chatterjee, they had registered a case against accused Prashant Sangra, a resident of Jaipur, and have started searching for him.

On September 9, 2017, he received a call and the person introduced himself as Aman Thakur. The caller said he was talking from MK Solutions and he could get Chatterjee a job in Asian Paints Company on the post of senior manager. In return, the caller asked him to pay Rs 1,999, which was immediately transferred into Aman’s account through mobile banking. Later, he received a call from Ayushi Mittal, who made him talk to Abhishek Sharma, claiming to be Asian Paints HR official. Abhishek told him to deposit money for the job in an account of the IDBI Bank in the name of Prashant Sangra. The complainant said, in many instalments, he deposited Rs15.30 lakh but later, he was again told to deposit Rs 5 lakh more in the account.

      <td>Brothers Piyush and Prasoon Pandey awarded the 2018 Lion of St. Mark Award in Cannes Saturday 23, June 2018 at 3:39 AM by CB Comments (0) The Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity has awarded brothers Piyush (right) and Prasoon Pandey (left) the Lion of St. Mark award at the 2018 Festival. Piyush Pandey, executive chairman and creative director Ogilvy South Asia won his first Cannes Lions awards with two Gold Lions for his work on an anti-smoking campaign in 2002, marking the start of a period of global recognition for a man who was already a creative legend in his native India. Piyush's work is considered instrumental in the popularity of advertising campaigns produced in Hindi during the 1980s and 90s, heralding a shift to more universally accessible creativity in India. Prasoon Pandey, younger brother of Piyush is a highly respected director whose name has repeatedly featured in global rankings of top film directors. Prasoon is credited for directing the first Indian campaign to win a Lion, for Ericsson's 'One Black Coffee' in 1996 and is one of the most awarded directors in India. They both were involved in one of Asia's most awarded commercials Fevicol "Bus" .Says Jose Papa, managing director of Cannes Lions: "The Lion of St. Mark recognises those who have made a significant and outstanding contribution to creativity in our industry. Piyush and Prasoon have undoubtedly made the world pay attention to creativity in India. While they are famous, and rightly so, in their homeland, I'm thrilled that we have this opportunity to celebrate their contributions to our industry on the Cannes Lions stage. The fact we get to honour the achievements of two brothers makes this year's Lion of St. Mark award particularly special."Says Piyush Pandey: "This is a huge, huge honour. I am humbled and immensely grateful to the people of India. It is the richness and diversity of this nation that gave my brother and me the opportunity to learn and to create good work. I am also indebted to my clients, my colleagues and Ogilvy who gave me the support and the freedom to fly. Thank you Cannes Lions for giving every creative professional in my country a reason to believe that if Prasoon and Piyush can do it, so can they."Says Prasoon Pandey: "The Lion of St Mark is an absolutely incredible and stunning honour for two 10-15 year-old kids from Jaipur who were just having a blast playing Emperors and Thugs, Dragons and Demons, dreaming stories and playing them out with some far more imaginative and talented friends. We were so engrossed in that play that we forgot that we were well into our 50s and 60s! This is such a huge and humbling honour for us; I just hope it doesn't make the kids inside us conscious."Piyush Pandey joined Ogilvy &amp; Mather in 1982, and made his name on work for Fevicol, Luna Moped, Cadbury and Asian Paints. In 1994 he was made national creative director for Ogilvy &amp; Mather India. Piyush was the first jury president from Asia at the 2004 Cannes Lions Festival. The Government of India awarded him the civilian honour of the Padma Shri in 2016.Prasoon Pandey started his career at Lintas Delhi, eventually becoming the creative director for Lowe India. He set up his own production company, Corcoise Films, in 2002.

He was already under investigation in Spain on charges that he and his father, Jorge Horacio Messi, used offshore companies in Belize and Uruguay to avoid paying millions of dollars in taxes when the Panama Papers revealed he owned yet another offshore company: Mega Star Enterprises, based in Panama. When asked about the company in April 2016, the Messis told ICIJ and partners that Mega Star was “totally inactive.” Internal emails from the newly-leaked Mossack Fonseca records call that claim into question. 15:41 (IST) 21 Jun 2018 Day after query on offshore ownership, Shishir Bajoria moved to get his name removed from records\nKolkata businessman Shishir K Bajoria, promoter of SK Bajoria Group with an annual turnover of $200 million, rushed to update Mossack Fonseca’s records two days after The Indian Express contacted him with queries on his beneficial ownership of an offshore firm in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) during the Panama Papers investigation.\nThe latest leak of documents shows that on March 23, 2016, First Names Group, an Isle of Man entity which set up Haptic (BVI) Ltd along with Mossack Fonseca, contacted the Panamanian law firm to update “beneficial ownership information… as soon as possible” from Shishir Kumar Bajoria to Charles Gary Hepburn. 15:35 (IST) 21 Jun 2018 Impact of 2016 expose\nNo of global inquiries: 150\nClients under probe in India: 426\nNo of searches, seizures in India: 58\nProsecutions filed in Indian courts: 16\nUndisclosed income detected in India: Rs 1088cr 15:33 (IST) 21 Jun 2018 The new 1.2 million files from the #PanamaPapers reveal the back-and-forth correspondence between Mossack Fonseca and various intermediaries A new leak from the #PanamaPapers reveals the chaotic scramble by Mossack Fonseca to survive. It also sheds light on unknown criminal investigations and reveals new findings about the world's global elite. https://t.co/wO1BSkLjt8 pic.twitter.com/Vk5uLxZpax 12:26 (IST) 21 Jun 2018 VIDEO: What did the 2016 Panama Papers reveal? 12:21 (IST) 21 Jun 2018 Among new names, telecom czar’s son, a business couple\nThree weeks before the Panama Papers were published in April 2016, internal email exchanges in Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca revealed names of UBOs (ultimate beneficial owners) of some previously registered companies, new records show.\nAmong them is KBM Global Limited, a company registered in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) by Mossack Fonseca in December 2008. Email exchanges between March 16 and March 17, 2016, show that the BO (beneficial owner) of the company is Kavin Bharti Mittal, founder and CEO of Hike Messenger and son of telecom czar Sunil Bharti Mittal. His Amrita Shergill Marg, New Delhi address is mentioned in the email exchanges where the name of the BO has been inserted. 11:46 (IST) 21 Jun 2018 New data spills more offshore secrets of Lionel Messi, Argentina President Mauricio Macri\nTwo years after the Panama Papers rocked the offshore financial system, a fresh document leak from the law firm Mossack Fonseca reveals new offshore details about an array of global elites, including soccer superstar Lionel Messi and the Argentine president’s family. 11:13 (IST) 21 Jun 2018 Soon after Panama Papers leak, Iqbal Mirchi’s family rejigged offshore holdings\nThe latest tranche of Panama Papers has unearthed new details of offshore holdings by the family of Iqbal Mirchi, who was once wanted by Mumbai Police and died in London five years ago. These documents reveal more details about Country Property Ltd, a British Virgin Islands (BVI) entity which was investigated by The Indian Express during the 2016 data leak linked to Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca. Country was incorporated in 2010 by Iqbal Mirchi’s wife, Hajra Iqbal Memon, and their two sons, Junaid Iqbal Memon and Asif Iqbal Memon. 10:52 (IST) 21 Jun 2018 Second largest firm in Paradise Papers data surfaces in new cache from Panama\nNew records investigated by The Indian Express show that the Khemka family, which had set up over hundred offshore entities incorporated by Bahamas law firm Appleby in the Paradise Papers revelations had similar ties to Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca. 10:40 (IST) 21 Jun 2018 Day after query on offshore ownership, Shishir Bajoria moved to get his name removed from records\nKolkata businessman Shishir K Bajoria, promoter of SK Bajoria Group with an annual turnover of $200 million, rushed to update Mossack Fonseca’s records two days after The Indian Express contacted him with queries on his beneficial ownership of an offshore firm in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) during the Panama Papers investigation. 10:27 (IST) 21 Jun 2018 Inside the fall of Mossack Fonseca – panic, chaos, and the end\nIn the weeks and months that following the Panama Papers leak, Mossack Fonseca employees frantically emailed bankers, accountants and lawyers – the professionals who had hired the firm to set up shell companies for wealthy clients who wanted to remain anonymous – in an attempt to close the gaps in its recordkeeping. Those intermediaries responded with panic and fury. 10:17 (IST) 21 Jun 2018 Mossack Fonseca managed three offshore firms for PVR’s Bijlis\nAround the time the Panama Papers uncovered the secret world of Mossack Fonseca, offshore companies linked to the Bijli family of PVR Cinema fame continued to do business with the Panamanian law firm. A pioneer in multiplex cinemas in India, Ajay Bijli, along with wife Selena and son Aamer, beneficially owned an offshore company set up to hold a property in the UK.\nRead more here.\nThe fresh investigation of Indian individuals and entities reveals how Mossack Fonseca, which serviced their accounts, scrambled to respond to an unprecedented global crackdown.\nTwo years after the Panama Papers blew the lid off how the global elite, including over 500 Indians, park and move their money in and out of secret tax havens, the Panama Papers are back — to reveal telling new details. More than 1.2 million fresh documents, at least 12,000 of them linked to Indians, have been investigated by The Indian Express, in collaboration with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung. Just as was done with the earlier set of over 11.5 million documents in 2016.\nThe fresh investigation — Panama Papers - The Aftermath — of Indian individuals and entities reveals how Mossack Fonseca, which serviced their accounts, scrambled to respond to an unprecedented global crackdown. Significantly, it also confirms the existence of several customers who had hitherto denied any links. And lifts the veil on the financial trail of new clients.\nThis second lot of the Panama Papers highlights details of offshore companies incorporated by a clutch of Indian businessmen who did not figure in the 2016 leak. These include Ajay Bijli, owner of PVR cinemas, and members of his family; Kavin Bharti Mittal, CEO of Hike Messenger and son of Sunil Mittal; and, Jalaj Ashwin Dani, son of Asian Paints promoter Ashwin Dani. © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd Tags:</td>

      <td>Sensex starts on negative note, falls 51 points Fri 22 Jun 2018, 11:01:53 Mumbai: The benchmark BSE Sensex got off to a lower start today, tracking a sell-off in global markets amid escalating trade war worries. The 30-share index, which had lost 114.94 points in the previous session, fell by another 50.91 points, or 0.14 per cent, to 35,381.48 in early trade. Capital goods, realty, infrastructure, power, healthcare and metal stocks showed weakness, falling by up to 0.35 per cent. The NSE Nifty also was quoting lower by 5.20 points, or 0.05 per cent, at 10,735.90. Major losers included Coal India, Reliance Industries, Asian Paints, SBI, Adani Ports, Sun Pharma, IndusInd Bank, Yes Bank, PowerGrid, Bajaj Auto, Maruti Suzuki and HDFC Bank, declining up to 1.40 per cent. According to traders, sustained selling by participants in line with a weak trend at other Asian markets following overnight losses at the Wall Street amid investor concerns about the trade dispute between the US and China dampened trading sentiments here. Meanwhile, India will raise customs duty on 29 products, including almond, walnut and pulses, imported from the US as a retaliatory action against the tariff hike by Washington. The duty hike would come into effect from August 4, the Finance Ministry said in a notification. In Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was down 0.15 per cent and Shanghai Composite shed 0.70 per cent in early trade today. Japan's Nikkei too fell 0.74 per cent. The US Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 0.80 per cent lower yesterday.</td>

      <td>Home » Money Why Indian paint makers are shifting to water-based paints Elevated input costs, especially crude oil prices, have taken the sheen off their gross margins in the past few quarters Last 05 31 PM IST Harsha Jethmalani Nearly 55% of raw materials used by paint companies are crude oil derivatives and account for about 30-35% of the total raw material cost of the sector. Indian paint makers are increasingly shifting from solvent-based to water-based paints. Elevated input costs, especially crude oil prices, have taken the sheen off their gross margins in the past few quarters.\nNearly 55% of raw materials used by paint companies are crude oil derivatives and account for about 30-35% of the total raw material cost of the sector. In the past one year, crude oil prices have jumped by more than 40%. Not just that, prices of pigments like titanium dioxide, iron oxide and zinc oxide also remain elevated ( see chart ).\nSo, considering the cost pinch, there’s a growing tendency to use water-based paints, simply because water-based paint is less sensitive to movement in crude oil prices. As the name suggests, for water-based paints the binding agent is water-based. For the solvent-based paints, crude oil is required.\nSecondly, the preference for water-based paints over solvent paints is also rising among customers because it is easier to clean walls painted with water-based paints, said an analyst with a domestic brokerage house. Also, the former is more environment-friendly.\nIn fact, the slew of recent capacity expansions announced by key paint companies is focused more on water-based units.\nFor instance, market leader in decorative paints Asian Paints Ltd’s plant in Mysuru has 600,000 kilolitres per annum water-based capacity. The company has a larger share of water-based paints than competitors, pointed out brokerage house Jefferies India Pvt. Ltd in a report dated 10 May.\nSimilarly, the leader in the industrial paints segment Kansai Nerolac Paints Ltd has been consistently increasing the share of water-based paints in its portfolio.\n“Nearly two-third of our revenue in the decorative paints category comes from water-based paints. In general, gross margins are better for water-based paints as compared to that for solvent-based,” Peeyush Bachlaus, general manager (marketing) at Kansai Nerolac Paints, said in an interview.\nHe added that globally, consumption of water-based paints is growing and demand is expected to remain high.\nMeanwhile, for now, paint makers are shielding their margins by taking price hikes. Most paint companies increased prices by 1.5% and 2% in March and May, respectively, of this calendar year. However, the rising share of water-based paints is expected to aid margin growth in the long term. First 09 14 AM IST</td>

      <td>\nMumbai, Jun 22 (PTI) Benchmarks weathered volatility to end sharply higher today, propelled by a late-session surge as investors snapped up healthcare, telecom and financials stocks amid mixed global cues.The BSE Sensex, which was trading flat with a negative bias for the major part of the day, spurted 257.21 points or 0.73 per cent to finish at 35,689.60. The broader NSE Nifty, after shuttling between 10,710.45 and 10,837, ended at 10,821.85 -- up 80.75 points or 0.75 per cent.Sentiment was buoyed after data showed that foreign portfolio investors (FPIs), who had been net sellers for the past several sessions, were back to buying mode on the domestic bourses.FPIs bought shares worth a net Rs 1,126.75 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) picked up equities to the tune of Rs 663.57 crore yesterday, provisional data showed.Both the Sensex and Nifty posted their fifth straight weekly gains, rising 67.46 points, or 0.19 per cent, and 4.15 points, or 0.04 per cent, respectively. On the global front, all eyes were on a crucial OPEC meet amid indications the oil cartel may agree to a production increase. "Market recouped yesterday's loses led by outperformance by pharma and banking stocks while appreciation in rupee also gave a positive sentiment to the broad market. "Oil price rose despite OPEC proposal to increase output by 1 mbpd. Investors may like to have a closer view on oil due to global risk. Trade tension and faster pace of tightening by Fed may refrain the market from a decisive uptick," said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.Sun Pharma stole the show in the Sensex pack, spurting 3.91 per cent, followed by M&amp;M at 2.87 per cent.

      <td>Suman Prasad\nThe retail market in India is estimated to reach USD 1.1 trillion by 2020 from USD 672 billion at present, with modern trade expected to grow at 20 percent per annum. This boom in the retail industry has accelerated the growth of retail fixture market in India.\nHowever, back in the days, retail design in India was at a nascent stage, highly unorganized and there were very few workshops that manufactured designs as per specifications. That is when S. Sundar, a NID graduate, along with his friends decided to set up their own facility which would translate their designs into actual forms as desired.\nIt was a chance meeting with a client, none other than the erstwhile popular clothing brand Weekender that set the start-up on a growth trajectory from where there was no looking back. The Weekender representative wanted to roll out a series of stores in India in 1986 for which they selected Studioline (now Dovetail), and asked them to set up 50 single-brand stores for the clothing brand between 1000-2000 feet for a few lakhs.\nDovetail started with an objective to design and manufacture furniture and fixtures. Today, they have their registered office and manufacturing facility at Bangalore which is spread across two acres and is equipped with the latest technology for wood, board, and metal working. Their 'Experience Centre' houses spacious design studios which showcase our latest products. The combination of skilled work force, latest technology and decades of industry experience enables Dovetail to take on large design-build furniture &amp; fixture projects in retail and institutional domains.\nSunder Subramaniam , Co-founder and Managing Director, Dovetail in Exclusive Interview with Unkrate spoke at length about Dovetail's clientele, retail scene in India, what do the future hold for this industry and other important things which you wouldn't want to miss.\nSunder Subramaniam Co-founder &amp; Managing Director, Dovetail\nExcerpt from the interview:\nLocal and global retail brands Dovetail have worked with\nWe have worked with many leading local and global retail brands. In fact, we are championed to be their preferred choice for their ongoing projects. To name a few, we have worked with Nautica, Unlimited, Saravana stores, Megamart, Peter England, Puma, Nike, Fastrack, mom &amp; me, Marks &amp; Spencer, fcuk, Aaddons, Motorola, Mom &amp; Me, William Penn, Brand Factory, Hometown, Tata teleservices, Bangalore Central, Food Bazaar, Big Bazaar, Asian paints, Kodak, Pantaloons, Levis, weekender, etc.\nRetail boom in India\nThe Indian retail industry is ripe for opportunities. The retail sector in India is fast emerging as one of the most dynamic and fast-paced industries today. Many global brands are entering the country directly or through acquisition, mergers or tie-ups. Indian consumers, especially the younger population now have higher expectations and their taste have evolved accordingly. Lately, the inclination of the Indian consumers towards international brands has become quite apparent. The sector growth is also fuelled by online E-retailers strengthening their offerings and opting for offline presence too. Another key factor for this retail boom is growing consumer base. The retail boom has been happening for decades and is only getting more and more stronger.\nThe change in the retail industry will only be towards betterment. There will be increased competition among existing players and this will also pave the way for new players. With innumerable players in the market and too many options to choose, consumers may get exhausted and may find it difficult in decision making. However, they tend to settle with brands that offers a consistent product quality, choice and service. Hence, some players may succeed while some may find it difficult to withstand the competition.\nThe retail boom will generate more business and will also drive up the quality levels. It will also create more employment opportunity for skilled labours.\nShop-fit changing the Indian Retail experience\nThe quality of shop-fit will get better and better and will be of the same quality as anywhere in the world. It will enhance the in-house shopping experience and in turn, play a vital role in retaining customers. It’s very important to attract and engage young consumers of the country and this is only possible when we provide them with better shopping experiences. This has prompted retail brands to invest on customer shopping experience . So retail brands are now more conscious about shop interiors, ambience, fixtures and shop fits.\nRetail industry over the years\nIn 1985, the focus was on small individual brand stores on main streets. Then a decade later, brands like Pantaloons started large format stores with totally modular arrangements, and at the same time global brands came in with their brand stores. Another decade later, malls were in full bloom and brands morphed into different store formats. In this decade, we are seeing attempts to integrate digital technology into stores as well as offering the customers with both online and offline options.\nAre the furniture manufacturers in India future ready?\nYes, of course. Both the established and promising players in this category are investing in enhanced technology, logistics and production methods to prepare for the demand and competition. At Dovetail itself, we are already future ready as we have invested in product innovation, design engineering and additional manufacturing capabilities. We are also embracing the change by adopting and as well as adapting to newer technologies.\n</td>

      <td>Story Panama Papers 2.0: New leak reveals fresh 12,000 documents linked to Indians The second set of Panama Papers - dubbed Panama Papers: The Aftermath - comprises more than 1.2 million fresh documents of which at least 12,000 are linked to Indians. BusinessToday.In New Delhi 16:06 IST\nIt's been over two years since the leaked Panama Papers first put the spotlight on the shadowy world of tax havens and offshore companies. It had also embarrassed several world leaders, famous personalities and leading businessmen by leaking evidence of money stashed abroad and prompted investigations into suspected tax evasion in several countries, India included.\nNow, prepare for round two. According to The Indian Express there is a second set of Panama Papers - dubbed Panama Papers: The Aftermath - comprising more than 1.2 million fresh documents of which at least 12,000 are linked to Indians. The daily, in collaboration with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung, investigated this second lot and discovered how Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca, which was at the epicentre of the massive 2016 leak, scrambled to respond to the ensuing unprecedented global crackdown. In the bargain, the law firm reportedly not only confirmed the existence of several customers who had hitherto denied any links but also unmasked new clients.\nAccording to the daily, among the names that did not figure in the 2016 leak are Ajay Bijli, owner of PVR cinemas, as well as members of his family and Kavin Bharti Mittal, CEO of Hike Messenger and son of Airtel's Sunil Mittal. Another new name is Jalaj Ashwin Dani, son of Asian Paints promoter Ashwin Dani. Famous names from outside India include football superstar Lionel Messi, Argentina's President Mauricio Macri's family and shell companies owned by iconic French jeweller Pierre Cartier.\nTo be sure, there are legitimate uses for offshore companies and trusts. Last November, over a year after the Panama Papers revealed that 426 Indians or persons of Indian origin had companies in the tax haven, the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) had said only 147 of them were "actionable" cases. The following month, sources from the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had said that out of the 45 cases that they were investigating, only around five were of serious nature - where the individuals had not informed the tax department of their offshore accounts or companies. The rest of them were more of technical violation. Nonetheless, data leaks like this are in public interest because they help expose wrongdoing.\nThe report adds that Panama Papers: The Aftermath show that several companies set up by Indians were initially sent notices by Mossack Fonseca to produce missing information. These notices mentioned the name/s of the Beneficial Owner (BO), wherever available, or demanded that the name be immediately disclosed. Several of them were sent out in November 2016, seven months after the scandal broke. In the next stage, the law firm served 90-day notices to clients saying that they would resign as the Registered Agent because the companies failed to meet legal due diligence requirements.\nFor instance, Mossack Fonseca, in its communications, named Amitabh Bachchan as director of two companies - Lady Shipping Ltd and Treasure Shipping Ltd. It subsequently served the 90-day notice to the actor via UK-based Minerva Trust - the administrator for these companies - addressing him as director of a third company, Sea Bulk Shipping Company Ltd. The notice conveyed Mossack Fonseca's intent to resign as the company's agent saying that Sea Bulk Shipping did not fulfil "our due diligence requirements".\nBachchan, who is under official scrutiny in connection with the Panama Papers, has denied any link to these companies.\nMossack Fonseca's message trail has similarly confirmed several other names boasting links to offshore entities. The list reportedly includes Shiv Khemka, son of SUN group patriarch Nand Lal Khemka; Dr Jehangir Sorabjee, son of ex-attorney general Soli Sorabjee; KP Singh of the DLF Group and his immediate family; politician Anurag Kejriwal and Navin Mehra of Mehrasons Jewellers. Even the underworld finds mention through Hajra Iqbal Memon, wife of Iqbal Mirchi, who was once Dawood Ibrahim's trusted aide.\nThe new set of documents also revealed that Mossack Fonseca's Indian clients reacted to the first leak very differently. While some Indian owners of offshore companies rushed to liquidate their firms, some not only asked Mossack Fonseca to continue as their agent, but also increased their holdings. Like Lokesh Sharma, owner of British Virgin Islands-based Mardi Gras Holdings, who increased his share capital 30 times in February 2017. Significantly, Kolkata businessman and BJP leader Shishir Bajoria, who had previously told the daily that his name in Mossack Fonseca records was a clerical mistake, contacted the law firm through an intermediary to change the beneficial ownership of Haptic (BVI) Ltd just days later. The firm was liquidated in May 2016. Around the same time, PRS Oberoi resigned as director of J&amp;W Inc, a Bahamas company.\nA Multi-Agency Group (MAG), comprising officials of CBDT, RBI, Financial Intelligence Unit and ED, had been set up to ensure "speedy and coordinated" probe against Indians whose names have figured in the Panama papers on the day of the expose itself. Prosecutions against 16 Indians have been filed in courts so far. According to CBDT - which reportedly heads the probe unit - till June 2018, undisclosed income totalling Rs 1,088 crore had been detected.\nWith PTI inputs</td>

      <td>Newsclick Report 22 Jun 2018\nTwelve lakh new documents, named Panama: Aftermath , have emerged, linking individuals and organisations to secret tax havens, with Indians in at least 12,000 of them. These are a result of the discoveries of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists(ICIJ) and German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, in collaboration with The Indian Express. The newly-leaked files reveal a hoard of other celebrities, politicians, and alleged criminals whose links to Mossack Fonseca, the firm that was in the spotlight during the first exposé, have not been reported and, often, that the firm itself didn’t know it represented.\nMossack Fonseca is a law firm based in Panama. It arranges investments by the rich and the powerful all across the globe in several offshore companies in a covert manner. Some 11.5 million files, however, were leaked to Süddeutsche Zeitung in 2016, from Mossack Fonseca, by a source, whose identity remains unknown. The information in the files leaked by this source covered the period from 1977 to December 2015. The journalists at the German newspaper decided to share it with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, of which they are also members. The files, examined by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, showed how several heads of State across the world, the friends and relatives of other top leaders and functionaries, celebrities and business tycoons, had been using this route to secretly stash away enormous amounts of money in offshore companies, in violation of the laws of their own countries, including of course tax laws, by using the services of Mossack Fonseca. This information was released in 2016.\nThe 12 lakh new documents are part of the second leak of documents related to Panama Papers since 2016 . Investigation reveals how Mossack Fonseca tried to respond to the allegations in 2016. In the process, it revealed the existence of several customers, including Indians, who had earlier denied their links. The new documents exposed names of many Indian businessmen that had incorporated overseas companies, these names weren’t listed in the 2016 Panama leaks. They include Ajay Bijli, owner of PVR Cinemas, and members of his family; Kavin Bharti Mittal, the chief executive officer of Hike Messenger and son of Sunil Mittal, and Jalaj Ashwin Dani, son of Asian Paints promoter Ashwin Dani, The Indian Express reported. The report says 426 clients from India are being investigated. Messages from Mossack Fonseca accessed at the time of the journalists’ investigation revealed the identities of Indians with links to offshore entities, the most prominent among them being actor Amitabh Bachchan , who has already been investigated. Others include SUN Group Vice Chairperson Shiv Khemka, KP Singh of the DLF Group and his immediate family, politician Anurag Kejriwal among others.\nThe new documents revealed that the Argentine president Mauricio Macri’s family was controlling a company in the Bahamas, Fleg trading Co. Emails between Mossack Fonseca’s head office in Panama and its Uruguay branch in September and October 2016 reveal employees discussing a plan to backdate documents to conceal the fact that the firm did not know that Fleg Trading Co., was controlled by the family of Argentine president Mauricio Macri. In March 2017, Mossack Fonseca discovered that a company it had registered in the British Virgin Islands was owned by Mohamed Nizam bin Abdul Razak, the brother of Malaysia’s former prime minister, Najib Razak. The company, Everbright Universal Holdings Ltd., owned property in the United States, according to the files. Najib Razak is now under the scanner as part of a probe into billions of dollars that went missing from the country’s state-owned investment fund during his reign. A focal point of the investigation has been $10.6 million that was transferred into a bank account owned by the former prime minister. The files reveal that a company registered by Mossack Fonseca was owned by Fahad al Rajaan, the former head of the agency that oversees Kuwait’s social security system. Also named in the files is Vitaly Malkin, a Russian oligarch who resigned a seat in the country’s senate in 2013 after reports that he had undeclared assets overseas. He is revealed to be the owner of two British Virgin Islands companies, Audrey Holdings Group Ltd. and Top Matrix Holdings Ltd. In July 2017, Mossack Fonseca learned that the Panama shell companies it had set up were controlled by heirs of iconic French jeweller Pierre Cartier. The companies owned a Canadian forest and Swiss bank accounts. Reporters discovered that Dariga Nazarbayeva, the daughter of Kazakhstan president Nursultan Nazarbayev, was the sole shareholder of a British Virgin Islands company. In October 2007, Nazarbayev became a shareholder of Asterry Holdings Ltd., which held a stake in sugar factories in Kazakhstan, via a chain of other companies.\nFrom Argentinian footballer Lionel Messi to Indian film star Amitabh Bachchan, from celebrities that enjoy the devotion of millions to politicians that enjoy the confidence of people, tax evasion is a skill they have all acquired. The Panama leaks make it clear that tax avoidance is characteristic to the functioning of modern capitalism. The rich and powerful across the globe make use of international tax havens to avoid paying taxes in their respective countries. On the one hand, major politicians of countries themselves are involved in such activities, they launder huge amounts of money in tax havens and invest in offshore companies. On the other hand, they claim to protect the national interest. National interest is antagonistic to the interests of these oligarchs that grow rich at the expense of not paying their taxes essentially meant for public welfare.</td>

      <td>Panama Papers second List reveals more Indian Names linked to Tax Heavens\nBlack Money Panama Papers second List reveals more Indian Names linked to Tax Heavens The Panama Papers — a partnership between 100 media organizations around the world that analyzed 11.5 million secret Mossack Fonseca documents exposed the dodgy world of offshore companies where rich people hide their black money which is later on turned into white money using legal loopholes.‘Panama Papers: The Aftermath‘ is a fresh investigation by The Indian Express, in collaboration with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and German newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung, of Indian individuals and entities who park and move their money in and out of safe havens. The new documents reveal that Mossack Fonseca couldn’t identify tens of thousands of owners of companies it had registered in opaque, low-tax jurisdictions. In 2016, 11.5 million documents leaked from Mossack Fonseca, a law firm in Panama, exposed the offshore financial links of a number of individuals and organisations It came to light how the global elite, over 500 of them Indians, parked their money in offshore companies and even move from one secret tax haven to another. In Pakistan PM Nawaz Shariff lost his chair, Pakistan took action on him.In India what happened I really do not know, my own belief is that no action was taken or the people paid little bit fine and avoided jail terms. Indian laws are full of loopholes so under name of technical fault , not serious nature rich players get protection only common man, service man fears the tax officers in India.The Indian clients, listed earlier by The Indian Express in the Panama Papers reports in April 2016, include companies where industrialist Anil Vasudev Salgaocar and his son, Arjun Anil Salgaocar, are listed as shareholders; companies owned by members of the Rosy Blue family; and offshore company owners or directors such as Lokesh Sharma, Satish Modi, Onkar Kanwar, Anurag Kejriwal and Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. In a pending list of nine entities sent by the Bahamas authorities in March 2017, seven are linked to Indian nationals. These entities are Lady Shipping Ltd, Tramp Shipping Ltd, Treasure Shipping Ltd (Amitabh Bachchan), J&amp;W Inc (P R S Oberoi), Insula International Ltd (K K Modi Investments &amp; Financial Services Ltd), The Threewells Foundation (Umesh Shahra), Consolidated (Holding) Ltd and LJ Management (IOM) Ltd (Raju Radhakrishna Shete), Asia Investment and Marketing Company Ltd (Ashwani Mehra et al) and Dunstan Investment Ltd (Chhotumati C Patel). 2 years after the Panama Papers revelations, new records show that entities linked to Indian nationals dominate the list of offshore companies on the radar of authorities in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) and the Bahamas. first set of records, which covered the late 1970s to 2015 The new leak of documents spans the period from early 2016 — just before journalists published the Panama Papers in April — through the end of 2017, a few months prior to the firm collapsing. The new 1.2 million files from the #PanamaPapers reveal the back-and-forth correspondence between Mossack Fonseca and various intermediaries The new leak: Munich’s Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper was given the new files, which were shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists.Its size: 1.2 million files, roughly 1/10th of the original 2.6 terabyte leak of 11.5 million files.Media partners: More than 100 journalists across globe which includes Indian Express.The fresh document leak from law firm Mossack Fonseca names a number of global elites including football superstar Lionel Messi, Argentina President Mauricio Macri and his family, and a former senior Kuwaiti official who was convicted of looting his country’s social security system, besides several Indian personalities. The new set of documents also revealed that Mossack Fonseca's Indian clients reacted to the first leak very differently. While some Indian owners of offshore companies rushed to liquidate their firms, some not only asked Mossack Fonseca to continue as their agent, but also increased their holdings. Like Lokesh Sharma, owner of British Virgin Islands-based Mardi Gras Holdings, who increased his share capital 30 times in February 2017. Significantly, Kolkata businessman and BJP leader Shishir Bajoria, who had previously told the daily that his name in Mossack Fonseca records was a clerical mistake, contacted the law firm through an intermediary to change the beneficial ownership of Haptic (BVI) Ltd just days later. The firm was liquidated in May 2016. Around the same time, PRS Oberoi resigned as director of J&amp;W Inc, a Bahamas company. Companies and individuals with links to offshore entities, which Mossack Fonseca confirmed in a series of messages, include Shiv Khemka, Amitabh Bachchan, Jehangir Sorabjee, K P Singh of the DLF Group and his immediate family, Anurag Kejriwal, Navin Mehra of Mehrasons Jewellers and Hajra Iqbal Memon and his family Shortly after the 2016 expose, the leaked documents show, Mossack Fonseca named Amitabh Bachchan as director of Lady Shipping Ltd and Treasure Shipping Ltd in its communications. Soon, a 90-day notice was served on him via UK-based Minerva Trust — the administrator for these two companies. Interestingly, the communication this time addressed the actor as the director of yet another firm, Sea Bulk Shipping Company Ltd, which it said did not meet “due diligence requirements”. Now Panama Papers 2.0 is back which has revealed more Indian names who parked their money in tax heaven.Two years down the line, the Panama Papers are back to haunt more individuals and organisations as new details have emerged with more than 1.2 million fresh documents being leaked.At least 12,000 of these documents are linked to Indians, according to The Indian ExpressThe second round of the expose, titled Panama Papers: The Aftermath, confirms the existence of several Indian entities, all clients of Mossack Fonseca, who had until now denied any links.

They also traced a link between Shiv Vikram Khemka, a son of SUN group patriarch Nand Lal Khemka, and a Russian helicopter manufacturer that was placed on a sanctions list by the US in 2015. Emails among Mossack Fonseca employees from October 9-27, 2017, reveal that the three members of the Khemka family are listed as PEPs (Politically Exposed Persons) because Nand Lal has been the Consul General for Jamaica and Iceland in India, and Shiv Vikram Khemka a board member of Vertolety Rossii AO, the Russian company.

Through The Pruak Foundation, they owned Biscay Overseas Ltd — later renamed Biscay Exports Ltd — and Krims Investments Inc, also based in the BVI. 11- Prithvi Raj Singh Oberoi and Deepak Madhok of the Oberoi Group - Barely a month after The Indian Express reported that Prithvi Raj Singh Oberoi and Deepak Madhok of the Oberoi Group were directors of a Bahamas company since November 2006, both resigned from the offshore entity on May 20, 2016. According to the records, before he resigned, Madhok appointed Singapore-based Tang Boon Tec as the director of J&amp;W Inc (Bahamas). Boon Tec also recorded himself as the beneficial owner of J&amp;W Inc through his Hong Kong company. 12 - London-based arms agent Sudhir Choudhrie and his son Bhanu Choudhrie - Arms agent Sudhir Choudhrie shifted base from Delhi to London in 2006 after his name featured in CBI probes into the contract to upgrade 130-mm field guns and the Barak missile deal. After Bhanu Choudhrie set up C&amp;C Alpha Group in 2002, both Sudhir and his son became UK citizens. The Indian Express reported on several offshore firms linked to London-based arms agent Sudhir Choudhrie and his son Bhanu Choudhrie Indian Express report to two of these entities set up in 2002 in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) — Anterna Ltd and Belinea Services Ltd — of which Bhanu was a director. Belinea was initially called Noversa Ltd. The “compliance note” pointed out that both father and son were arrested in 2014, as part of a Serious Fraud Office probe in London for allegedly helping Rolls-Royce pay bribe to secure contracts in China and Indonesia. In India, it noted, the Ministry of Defence also ordered a CBI inquiry into the purchase of aero engines by HAL from Rolls-Royce. The latest data shows that Mossack Fonseca’s UK office informed its BVI arm that Bhanu had resigned as director of Anterna on January 27, 2016, after all 50,000 shares were transferred in November 2015 from a Seychelles entity — Protype Services Inc — to Sumant Kapur, the son of Sudhir Choudhrie’s uncle B K Kapur. Records show that Sumant Kapur, executive director of C&amp;C Alpha Group set up in the UK by Bhanu as a family-owned private equity firm, was replaced by Dubai-based Aman Chopra as the beneficiary owner of Anterna in May 2010. But internal documents of Mossack Fonseca continued to list Kapur as holder of the company’s bearer shares in 2011. Chopra was a director and shareholder of Prototype Services Inc, which had transferred all of its shares of Anterna to Kapur. In October 2016, The Indian Express reported that Chopra had joined Bhanu on the board of directors of Belinea in May 2010. Hollister Consulting Inc, one of four Seychelles firms linked to Chopra, was the sole shareholder of Belinea. In 2011, after the CBI gave a “clean chit” to Sudhir Choudhrie in the Rs 208-crore deal between Israeli firm Soltam and the Ministry of Defence, the Enforcement Directorate commenced a probe into financial transactions of the deal but did not find any evidence of violations. The CBI closed the case in the Barak missile deal in 2013. 13- India - Kolkata businessman Shishir K Bajoria, promoter of SK Bajoria Group with an annual turnover of $200 million, rushed to update Mossack Fonseca’s records two days after The Indian Express contacted him with queries on his beneficial ownership of an offshore firm in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) during the Panama Papers investigation.The latest leak of documents shows that on March 23, 2016, First Names Group, an Isle of Man entity which set up Haptic (BVI) Ltd along with Mossack Fonseca, contacted the Panamanian law firm to update “beneficial ownership information… as soon as possible” from Shishir Kumar Bajoria to Charles Gary Hepburn.on May 3, Haptic was included in a list of 69 companies sent by BVI’s Financial Investigation Agency (FIA) to Mossack Fonseca seeking more details. On May 10, the law firm reported Bajoria as the beneficial owner of Haptic to the FIA. Bajoria belongs to one of the oldest business families in Kolkata trading in jute and tea — the SK Bajoria Group has steel refractory units in six countries. Bajoria joined the BJP in August 2014. Kolkata businessman and BJP leader Shishir K Bajoria claimed that reference to him in offshore entity’s books was an error.14- India - Jalaj Ashwin Dani &amp; Vita Dani - Jalaj Ashwin Dani. He stepped down from his position of eminence in Asian Paints in April 2017, after 18 years in the family trade. Several documents in the new data link Dani and his wife Vita Dani to a BVI entity called Poinsettia Group Holdings Limited. Dani is currently listed as being on the board of 38 Indian companies while his wife is on the board of nine companies and chairperson of 11Sports, a sports management company. A scrutiny of the new data shows that between April and July 2016, changes were made in the management of the company while Mossack Fonseca remained its Registered Agent. The intermediary company of Poinsettia Group Holdings changed from Chesterfield Management Nominees, located in the Isle of Man, to Nedgroup Private Wealth Corporate Services Limited, located in Jersey.

Of this, at least 12,000 are linked to Indians that figure in the set of papers produced by Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca. The second set of ‘Panama Papers’ details offshore companies, incorporated by Indian businessmen who did not figure in the 2016 leak, including Ajay Bijli, owner of PVR Cinemas, and members of his family; Kavin Bharti Mittal, chief executive officer of Hike Messenger and son of Sunil Bharti Mittal; and Asian Paints promoter Ashwin Dani’s son Jalaj Ashwin Dani, it was reported on Thursday. After the initial leak in 2016, the government constituted a multi-agency group, headed by the chairman of the Central Board of Direct Taxes, to make enquiries into Indians named in the papers.

      <td>June expiry may keep markets volatile this week; book profit on rallies: GEPL Capital Given the small premium of 46-50, that the 10,850-CE governs, it would be worthwhile to buy it with possible targets around Rs 150-200 ahead of expiry, Pushkaraj Sham Kanitkar, AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.\nGiven the small premium of 46-50, that the 10,850-CE governs, it would be worthwhile to buy it with possible targets around Rs 150-200 ahead of expiry, Pushkaraj Sham Kanitkar, AVP - Technical Research at GEPL Capital, said in an interview with Moneycontrol’s Kshitij Anand.\nQ) The Nifty50 on weekly basis closed flat but with a negative bias. What does weekly, and monthly chart tell about the technical picture? A) The last hour has seen market claw back the lost ground, in fact by closing up by around 5 points for the week. Nonetheless, the picture still remains pretty fluid. While in the last week, the Nifty50 candle showed upper shadow (Corrected from 10,893 to 10,817), the current week is showing a lower shadow (bounced from 10,701 to 10,821). These shadows in a way define the immediate barriers placed between levels of 10,701-10,893. The monthly candle too is currently seen forming an “Inside Month”, which would mean that one needs to wait for the market to move past the extremities for a clear direction.\nQ) Next week is June expiry -- any particular strategy which investors can deploy ahead of the event? A) The market has remained in a sideways tranche for almost 3-4 weeks now, which indicates to a compression of the spring. The fact that Nifty is seeing support at lower levels and the strength amongst the heavyweights brings us to believe that market might make an attempt to take on lifetime highs over the next week or 10 days. Given the small premium of Rs 46-50, that the 10,850-CE governs, it would be worthwhile to buy it with possible targets around Rs 150-200 (Around 11,000 on the Nifty).\nQ) Plenty of stocks hit fresh 52-week lows this week instead of 52-week high. We have seen that happening throughout June. The absence of buying in broader markets is likely to cap upside for markets, and what should investors do with stocks hitting lows -- hold or exit? A) The major momentum that the Nifty is deriving is coming out of strength in certain heavyweights. While earlier it was banks, and now the momentum has shifted to IT pack and Reliance Industries which have come to the rescue. We had categorically stated in our earlier outlook as well, that the midcap-smallcap are a strict no-no, given the intrinsic weakness in individual stocks and in indices as a whole. We still stand by our hypothesis that the broader indices may further correct by around 5-7 percent. Hence, one could be looking at opportunities for exiting these scrips on any fruitful rise.\nQ) What is your call on smallcap and midcap stocks? Should investors stay away or just book profits on rallies? A) Once again we would go by our hypothesis and recommend to book profit on rallies.\nQ) Top 3-5 positional calls which could give handsome returns to investors in next 1 month? A) As mentioned earlier we would prefer going with the frontliners and our picks are:\nCipla : Buy| CMP: Rs 615| Target: Rs 660| Stop loss: Rs 595| Return 7% Kotak Mahindra Bank: Buy| CMP: Rs 1,320| Target: Rs 1,420| Stop loss: Rs 1,290| Return 8% Asian Paints: Buy| CMP: Rs 1,268| Target: Rs 1,330| Stop loss: Rs 1,221| Return 6%\nFinancial Advisory Company in Indore , Stock Advisory Company in Indore , Equity Tips , Free Trading Tips , MCX Tips , sebi registered advisory company , Intraday stock tips , Free commodity tips Investment &amp; trading in securities market is always subjected to market risks, past performance is not a guarantee of future performance.

He became a tax resident in India on account of his presence to manage tech start-up from the financial year 2011-12 and accordingly the tax returns filed with the tax authorities provide full disclosure and details about his ownership of KBM Global,” the official said. Minerva Trust &amp; Corporate Services, a reputed professional service provider, is the appointed administrator of KBM Global.\n“They have informed us that they moved all their clients to Harney’s Corporate Services in 2016 for registered agency services,” the official said.\nKavin is founder and chief executive officer of Hike Messenger and son of Sunil Bharti Mittal.\nThe fresh leaks showed that six months after the earlier Panama Paper leaks, a notice was published by British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission with the information that the registered agent of the company had been changed from Mossack Fonseca to Harney’s Corporate Services, both located in Tortola in the British Virgin Islands (BVI).\nThe other set of documents showed that how the shareholding pattern of these two companies changed in March 2106 and how 14 shares from Anten Resources, which was another shareholder of KBM Global, were transferred to Minerva Nominees.\nThese shares were held under declaration of trust for Kavin Bharti Mittal.\nDani said, “You will appreciate that your presumption, if any, that our investments are illegal, is ill-founded. Please note that this investment is legal and we have reported this investment in our returns to the I-T authorities as well.”\nThe fresh leaks showed that Dani, who resigned from Asian Paints in April 2017, and his wife Vita Dani were linked to a BVI entity called Poinsettia Group Holdings.\nNaveen Wadhwa, tax experts at Taxmann, said all ordinary residents filing return of income (ITR) for the financial year 2011-2012 and subsequent years were required to disclose their foreign assets and income earned outside India.\n“In case a taxpayer failed to disclose such details in ITR then the same shall be deemed to be an undisclosed income of taxpayer.\n"Any undisclosed income detected by the I-T department, in case of person found during Panama Paper leak, would be taxed at a flat rate of 60 per cent plus a further penalty of 10 per cent of tax,” he said. The finance ministry said the Panama Paper leaks involving 426 people have been already investigated by the I-T department and other member agencies of the MAG.\nAfter thorough investigation, involving examination of the disclosures made in the ITRs, particularly the foreign assets (FA) schedule, residential status, responses to questionnaires issued, responses received from foreign jurisdictions and details of foreign remittances made, 352 cases were found to be non-actionable, the ministry said.\nAmong other 74 cases, it said “invasive actions” were taken in 62 cases, with searches conducted in 50 cases, and surveys in 12 cases leading to detection of undisclosed foreign investments of about Rs 1,140 crore.\nIn 16 cases, criminal prosecution complaints have been filed in jurisdictional courts which are at various stages of hearing. In 32 cases, notices under Section 10 of the Black Money Act have been issued.\n“The investigations conducted in Panama Paper cases reflect the government’s continued focus in dealing with black money stashed abroad. The promptness in action is more than evident as most of the actionable cases have been effectively addressed,” the ministry said. It further said that though the investigating agencies faced problems of incomplete data and absence of financial information as well as not very prompt cooperation from other countries, the overall outcome has been “very satisfactory”.\nThe government would like to assure that the fresh series of Panama Papers information would also be effectively addressed within a reasonable time frame, it said.\nThe ministry said that the standard operating procedures in place for investigating such cases will be followed.\nThe procedure involves examining the information revealed in the media release with the disclosures made by the alleged persons in the annual returns of income filed, particularly in the FA schedule, foreign remittance details will be undertaken expeditiously, followed by raising of relevant queries.

      <td>New direct tax law: Focus should be on facilitating taxpayer services\nThe government started its investigations into the fresh Panama Paper leaks, even as those named denied any wrongdoing. The finance ministry on Thursday said the fresh revelations are being looked into by the Multi Agency Group (MAG), headed by the Central Board of Direct Taxes chairman as its convener and comprising representatives of the income-tax (I-T) department, Enforcement Directorate, Financial Intelligence Unit, and the Reserve Bank of India.\n“The fresh release... under the Panama Paper leaks is being promptly looked into by the law enforcement agencies under the aegis of the MAG already constituted for facilitating coordinated and speedy investigation,” the ministry said in a release.\nThe Panama Paper leaks were originally revealed by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists on April 4, 2016, following which, the government had set up the MAG to probe the matter.\nMeanwhile, businessman Jalaj Ashwin Dani and KBM Global, named in the fresh leaks, refuted all allegations.\nA company official on behalf of Kavin Bharti Mittal (KBM) said KBM is the sole beneficial shareholder of KBM Global.\nHe said the company was set up by KBM in 2008 for pursuing business activities and making investments in the tech sector.\n“KBM is a British citizen by birth and an Overseas Citizen of India. He became a tax resident in India on account of his presence to manage tech start-up from the financial year 2011-12 and accordingly the tax returns filed with the tax authorities provide full disclosure and details about his ownership of KBM Global,” the official said.\nMinerva Trust &amp; Corporate Services, a reputed professional service provider, is the appointed administrator of KBM Global.\n“They have informed us that they moved all their clients to Harney’s Corporate Services in 2016 for registered agency services,” the official said.\nKavin is founder and chief executive officer of Hike Messenger and son of Sunil Bharti Mittal. ALSO READ: Panama Papers: Multi Agency Group looking into fresh revelations: FinMin The fresh leaks showed that six months after the earlier Panama Paper leaks, a notice was published by British Virgin Islands Financial Services Commission with the information that the registered agent of the company had been changed from Mossack Fonseca to Harney’s Corporate Services, both located in Tortola in the British Virgin Islands (BVI).\nThe other set of documents showed that how the shareholding pattern of these two companies changed in March 2106 and how 14 shares from Anten Resources, which was another shareholder of KBM Global, were transferred to Minerva Nominees. These shares were held under declaration of trust for Kavin Bharti Mittal.\nDani said, “You will appreciate that your presumption, if any, that our investments are illegal, is ill-founded. Please note that this investment is legal and we have reported this investment in our returns to the I-T authorities as well.” The fresh leaks showed that Dani, who resigned from Asian Paints in April 2017, and his wife Vita Dani were linked to a BVI entity called Poinsettia Group Holdings.\nNaveen Wadhwa, tax experts at Taxmann, said all ordinary residents filing return of income (ITR) for the financial year 2011-2012 and subsequent years were required to disclose their foreign assets and income earned outside India.\n“In case a taxpayer failed to disclose such details in ITR then the same shall be deemed to be an undisclosed income of taxpayer. Any undisclosed income detected by the I-T department, in case of person found during Panama Paper leak, would be taxed at a flat rate of 60 per cent plus a further penalty of 10 per cent of tax,” he said.\nThe finance ministry said the Panama Paper leaks involving 426 people have been already investigated by the I-T department and other member agencies of the MAG.\nAfter thorough investigation, involving examination of the disclosures made in the ITRs, particularly the foreign assets (FA) schedule, residential status, responses to questionnaires issued, responses received from foreign jurisdictions and details of foreign remittances made, 352 cases were found to be non-actionable, the ministry said. ALSO READ: Decoding the link between NuPower's largest shareholder and Panama papers Among other 74 cases, it said “invasive actions” were taken in 62 cases, with searches conducted in 50 cases, and surveys in 12 cases leading to detection of undisclosed foreign investments of about Rs 11.40 billion.\nIn 16 cases, criminal prosecution complaints have been filed in jurisdictional courts which are at various stages of hearing. In 32 cases, notices under Section 10 of the Black Money Act have been issued.\n“The investigations conducted in Panama Paper cases reflect the government’s continued focus in dealing with black money stashed abroad. The promptness in action is more than evident as most of the actionable cases have been effectively addressed,” the ministry said.\nIt further said that though the investigating agencies faced problems of incomplete data and absence of financial information as well as not very prompt cooperation from other countries, the overall outcome has been “very satisfactory”.\nThe government would like to assure that the fresh series of Panama Papers information would also be effectively addressed within a reasonable time frame, it said.\nThe ministry said that the standard operating procedures in place for investigating such cases will be followed.\nThe procedure involves examining the information revealed in the media release with the disclosures made by the alleged persons in the annual returns of income filed, particularly in the FA schedule, foreign remittance details will be undertaken expeditiously, followed by raising of relevant queries.

      <td>Wood Coatings Market Key Drivers &amp; on-Going Trends 2017 - 2025\nAlbany, NY -- ( SBWIRE ) -- 06/20/2018 -- Presence of numerous companies makes the global wood coatings market highly competitive. Prominent companies operating in the global wood coatings market show high degree of forward integration, which provides them with a decided competitive advantage. Apart from that, manufacturers are also seen focusing on product differentiation to entice more customers. Some of the key players in the market are BASF SE, PPG Industries Inc., the Asian Paints, Nippon Paints Holdings, the Dow Chemical Company, and Sherwin-Williams Company. Read Report Overview @ https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/wood-coating-market.html The top four companies, namely The Sherwin Williams Company, PPG Industries Inc., Akzo Novel N.V. and RPM International Inc. accounted for almost 60.0% share in the global wood coatings market in 2016. Of them, The Sherwin Williams Company led the market with a majority share of 21.3% in 2016. A noticeable trend in the global wood coatings market is the foray of small and medium manufacturers which has served to intensify the competition. Most of them are banking upon product differentiation to establish a foothold in the market. A report by Transparency Market Research predicts the revenue in the global wood coating market to expand at a healthy CAGR of 8.3% from 2017 to 2025 to reach a value of US$17.595 bn by 2025 from US$8.625 bn in 2016. Volume-wise, it predicts the market to exhibit a CAGR of 7.5%. Powered by Emerging Economies, Asia Pacific Leads Market Depending upon the type of resin, the global wood coatings market is segmented into polyurethane, acrylics, melamine formaldehyde, nitrocellulose, etc. Of them, the segment of polyurethane accounts for maximum market share and going forward too is expected to retain the share by registering a CAGR of 8.8% between 2017 and 2025. This is because polyurethane is scratch and humidity resistant. Regionally, the segments of the global wood coatings market studied in the report are North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific, Europe, and the Middle East and Africa. Asia Pacific, among them, leads the market with maximum share powered by the densely populated emerging economies in the region.

The region is slated to grow its dominant share slightly by 2025 to 47.4%. Booming Housing Construction Activities Stokes Growth Majorly fuelling growth in the global wood coatings market are the growing number of housing construction activities worldwide and the increasing disposable incomes of people which has driven up sales of furniture. Environmental regulations placed on emission of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is also providing headwinds to the market. As per the lead analyst of the TMR report, "Numerous initiatives for bringing down emission of VOCs have taken by industries and organizations. Growing awareness about coatings with low volatile organic compounds and implementation of safety regulations have resulted in the swift uptake of wooden coatings. Request to view Sample Report: https://www.transparencymarketresearch.com/sample/sample.php?flag=S&amp;rep_id=12161 Fluctuating Raw Material Prices Pose Challenge Posing headwinds to the market for wood coatings, on the other hand, is the volatility in raw material prices. Acrylic and polyurethane are the primary raw materials used in the manufacture of wood coatings. Since they are dependent on the prices of crude oil, their prices get affected thereby posing a challenge to the market. This review is based on the findings of a TMR report, titled, "Wood Coatings Market (Resin – Polyurethane, Acrylics, Melamine Formaldehyde, and Nitrocellulose; Product - Stains and Varnishes, Shellacs, and Lacquers; Technology - Oil Based, Water Based, and Solvent Based; Application - Furniture, Cabinets, and Side and Deck) - Global Industry Analysis, Size, Share, Growth, Trends, and Forecast 2017 - 2025.

      <td>Business Ethics: Some outstanding Indian examples Posted Date: | Updated: 18-Jun-2018 | Category: About IndiaStudyChannel | Author: ABSivakumar | Member Level: Gold | Points: 80 | In business, ethics is very important. If the owners or promoters do not follow ethics, they will have ruined the banks, the suppliers, and the employees. The wider public would suffer too. However, in India, we have some really outstanding examples, and what we have is a superb mosaic of very good practices from the outstanding examples. The finer details of such examples are discussed in this article. Introduction Business ethics is the foundation of any successful business. Any business organization that seeks to serve the society, its employees, its suppliers, and not merely the promoters or owners, will survive as an institution known for business ethics of a tall order. There are three essential qualities that need to be nurtured by any such business organization. These are: a) looking at ethics and all that it stands for, as more important than the business itself b) institutionalizing processes that clearly communicate business ethics as the most important bedrock of the organization, in totality and c) making business ethics, a way of life in the organization. There are some superb examples in India. These examples are sought to be discussed in some detail, with reference to the essential qualities outlined above. Business Ethics more important than the business itself When business ethics becomes more important than the business itself, magic happens. The business organization attains a stature totally unheard of, in the history of business ethics itself.Take the Tata group, as an example. Some years ago, the Tata group suffered a set back, when one five star property in Mumbai was caught in the terrorist attack. The Government stepped in and the militants were shot dead. However, the damage to the property ran into several thousands of crores.Ratan Tata, the then Chairman, did something that is totally out of the world. He in fact taught the world some lessons in business ethics. Every single person who was affected, including those like the pav bhaji vendor outside the hotel, was offered compensation running into several lakhs of rupees. The education of children of those affected, free medical facilities for those survivors and dependents at Tata hospitals for the rest of their lives, total education of the 46 children who were affected by the bomb blast but survived, to be taken up by the Tata group, in total, and formation of a Trust for the rehabilitation of the families of the victims. Tata himself visited the families of each of the 80 employees affected by the bomb blast, and offered compensation running into several lakhs of rupees. This was business ethics at its best. The story did not end there. Rs.10,000 per month was also offered as compensation for policemen who had nothing to do with the blast at the hospital, but were involved elsewhere. Ratan Tata had clearly spelt what the Tata group stands for, to this day.Ditto for the WIPRO group. Its Chairman, Azim Premji, is firm in his views. He annoyed several other fellow capitalists when he said that rich people should pay more taxes, in response to some budget proposal. Not stopping there, he justified his views in many interviews as well. WIPRO has spent upwards of some nine hundred crores in Karnataka and in Andhra Pradesh, where it has helped build school infrastructure, improve standards of education and so on. Its donations to several Government hospitals in Tamil Nadu is very much an example of the highest quality of business ethics. Within the organization, ethics is a way of life. Several years ago, a trade union leader was sacked on the spot in Mumbai when he faked a bill for Rs.20/-. A big strike followed. The strike went on for six months, but the employee was not reinstated. Azim Premji said that he would rather close the office than reinstate the trade union leader. The employees called off the strike, after a period of six months. Institutionalizing processes to communicate business ethics Institutionalizing processes that clearly communicate business ethics is an art, fine tuned by the best companies. For instance, in Chennai, a TVS group company called Sundram Finance would serve all its senior citizen customers in ten minutes flat. No questions asked. Free financial advice is given on tax matters. It has over two thousand crores in fixed deposits, mostly collected from senior citizens. The deposit interest is not high, slightly more than what is offered in banks. Still, the money comes in. The interest is credited one day in advance, if the 1st of the month is a holiday. Not a single amount of interest has ever been unpaid to any customer, at any point in time. The organization has a huge network of borrowers, who also repay dues on time, as they know the value of TVS, which actually stands for Trust, Values and Service. The different TVS group companies have one thing in common in all their factories. Each employee carries home a small gift, in the form of some eatable, like a small biscuit packet, a packet of banana chips, or potato chips and so on. This is illustrative of the philosophy of the TVS group: care and share. This is also reflected in the fact that there are third generation employees happily working in the same TVS group. The quality of the products of the TVS group is world-class, which itself communicates the best to the best-in-class customers like General Motors and Ford: our ethical standards will always produce such products. The Murugappa group of companies in Chennai is another outstanding example of business ethics. They never bribe a single official. Everything is done in a very transparent manner. The owners are all people well known for their business ethics. In TVS and the Murugappa group, even very small amounts are paid only through cheques or through bank transfers. Business ethics also means that the organization's employees pay all their taxes in time, and in total. In each of the aforesaid employees, Income tax is deducted and paid to the Government authorities, right on time. Making Business Ethics a way of life Making business ethics a way of life naturally follows. In each of the outstanding examples discussed above, one would notice that it is possible for business ethics to have a continuous flow, as it is built into the DNA of the organization itself. Asian Paints is another organization, well known for its business ethics. Similarly, the Hero group is also well known for its high quality business ethics. The outstanding organizations offer such a good variety of experiences in business ethics in a world where values are being eroded all over. However, such short term successes will never stand the test of time. Only those organizations that follow business ethics in every walk of life, like the Tata group, the TVS group, the WIPRO group or the Murugappa group, will continue to survive and grow as highly ethical organizations for generations to come. And be admired for such high class values forever.</td>

      <td>Most Asian and European markets traded lower on uncertainties surrounding US-China trade relations. (Express photo by Ganesh Shirsekar/Files) Stocks surrendered early gains to finish with losses on Thursday as lingering worries over global trade and lack of definitive domestic triggers held investors back. Unabated capital outflows by foreign funds and a weakening rupee too weighed on sentiment, brokers said.\nThe 30-share BSE Sensex, which rose over 131 points in morning trade, soon lost momentum in choppy trade. It finally ended at 35,432.39, down 114.94 points, or 0.32 per cent. The broader NSE Nifty, after shuttling between 10,809.60 and 10,725.90, finished 30.95 points, or 0.29 per cent lower at 10,741.10.\nMost Asian and European markets traded lower on uncertainties surrounding US-China trade relations. Meanwhile, India slapped retaliatory tariffs on a clutch of goods imported from the US, joining the EU and China in taking counter-measures against duties imposed by the Trump administration.\nMinutes of RBI’s June policy meeting, released after market hours on Wednesday, flagged inflation risks on the back of factors like firm oil prices and volatile global financial markets, which further sapped confidence.\nForeign portfolio investors (FPIs) net sold shares worth Rs 1,442.61 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) bought equities worth Rs 1,473.65 crore yesterday, provisional data showed.\n“Market continued to be under pressure as trade tensions between the US and China is getting escalated.\n“Emerging markets including India were under-performing due to FII selling. OPEC meeting tomorrow will be a key event, relaxation in production cuts will provide some relief to Indian markets,” said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.\nBucking the trend, Reliance Industries continued its upward trajectory, spurting 1.22 per cent to a fresh closing high of Rs 1,032.35. Other index gainers were ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Tata Motors and Infosys.\nHowever, M&amp;M emerged as the biggest loser in the Sensex pack by falling 2.11 per cent, followed by ONGC 1.90 per cent, PowerGrid 1.88 per cent, SBI 1.67 per cent, Sun Pharma 1.67 per cent, Asian Paints 1.39 per cent and Bajaj Auto 1.37 per cent, among others.\nAmong the sectoral indices, healthcare fell 1.11 per cent, capital goods 1.09 per cent, metal 0.98 per cent, infrastructure 0.93 per cent, power 0.91 per cent, auto 0.90 per cent, PSU 0.85 per cent, consumer durables 0.84 per cent, FMCG 0.58 per cent, realty 0.51 per cent, bank at 0.38 per cent, tech 0.31 per cent and IT 0.12 per cent. Oil and gas, however, managed to end in the green, inching up 0.60 per cent.\nThe broader markets too came under selling pressure. The BSE small-cap and mid-cap indices fell by 0.79 per cent and 0.53 per cent, respectively.\nShares of Bank of Maharashtra slumped 1.19 per cent following the arrest of its chief executive officer in a cheating case. Globally, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng fell 1.35 per cent, Shanghai Composite Index lost 1.37 per cent, while Japan’s Nikkei gained 0.61 per cent. In the Eurozone, Frankfurt’s DAX dropped 0.51 per cent, while Paris CAC 40 lost 0.21 per cent in early deals. London’s FTSE was up 0.05 per cent.\n</td>

      <td>Equity99\nThe upcoming week will be quite volatile on the back of June series’ expiry in F&amp;O market. On Monday, investors could react to the outcome of the OPEC meeting and crude prices would be closely watched along with OMCs.\nGeopolitics will remain in focus and developments in the trade spat between the US and China will be closely watched. India will hold meetings with US officials on June 26.\nVarroc Engineering’s IPO will open the same day as well and will close on June 28.\nD-Street will also react on outcomes of Nifty majors’ AGMs like Asian Paints, SBI, HDFC Bank and HUL. Asian Paints will hold it’s AGM on June 26, while SBI will hold its AGM on June 28.\nHDFC Bank and HUL will hold their respective AGMs on June 29.\nSeveral midcap companies’ board meetings will be held next week for fund raising. Some names include Zuari Agro, Sharda Corp, Karur Vysya Bank, Capital First, PNB Housing Finance, DHFL, Zodiac Clothing and JK Cements.\nHere are three stocks to focus on.\nTata Steel | Rating: Buy\nTata Steel plans to double its existing domestic capacity in the next 5 years through a mix of organically like debottlenecking Kalinganagar plant for 5mmtpa and Jamshedpur for ~1mmtpa. It’s acquisition of both Bhushan assets under IBC will also add inorganic capex.\nTata Steel is banking upon limited capacity addition and strong demand growth in India. India’s steel demand has remained strong over the last few quarters with 5%+ growth in the past 8 months.\nWe believe Tata Steel is an ideal play on the domestic steel growth story, with the acquisition of Bhushan Steel is expected to provide volume growth in the near term. We are recommending a BUY.\nSun Pharma | Rating: Buy\nSun Pharma had received an Establishment Inspection Report from the USFDA for its Halol facility. This plant was last inspected in February 2018, a warning letter status since December, 2015 wherein the FDA issued three observations for the injectable manufacturing block. This EIR implies closure of both the observations and the warning letter issue.\nAs the regulatory issue at Halol has been resolved, new ANDA approvals held back for the last three years should commence. Plus, the company should be able to gradually increase sales for the current portfolio, where it had lost market share. We are recommending a BUY.\nSuryaamba Spinning Mills | Rating: Buy\nSuryaamba Spinning Mills is a leading manufacturer of specialty synthetic spun yarns. The core competitive strength of the company is its innovative product range, specifically tailor-made for the customers.\nThe company has current capacity of 45,000 spindles with the state of the art ultra-modern manufacturing machinery. It has installed value addition equipment, aims to fulfill the demand of export market and enhance profitability, with a capital expenditure of Rs. 10cr. It plans to fund this capex by using a mix of promoter's equity, retained earnings and debt to ensure sustainable growth for the company in the future.\nThe Company expects good demand for its products in domestic as well as international markets. The domestic market is on the path of healthy growth because of the demonetization and GST. We believe Suryaamba is well placed to capture this structural shift aided by solid management pedigree hence we are recommending a BUY.</td>
